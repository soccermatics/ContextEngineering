Benik Afobe has “moved on” from the disappointment of failing to break into the first team at Arsenal and is eager to make his mark against the club through whose academy he graduated when the London side venture to Bournemouth for the first time on Sunday. The Leyton-born England Under-21 international’s association with Arsenal began at the age of six when he was signed having impressed a scout while playing for a Sunday junior side, Eclipse, in Dagenham. While he never represented the senior side under Arsène Wenger, there were loan spells at six clubs before a £2m move to Wolverhampton Wanderers a year ago. Afobe’s prolific form there earned him a £10m return to the Premier League last month. The striker has enjoyed an impressive start on the south coast, his headed winner in Tuesday’s trip to Crystal Palace a third reward in successive games with the 22-year-old acknowledging the huge influence Arsenal have had on his development. “They have been massively responsible because I was there from when I was six,” he said. “At six you’re still a young boy, a baby really. They’ve played a big part in the way I play football and helped me progress as a player, so I’ve got a lot to thank them for and I respect them a lot. “Arsenal always bang on about how, technically, as a centre-forward you have to hold the ball up, have a good first touch … all that stuff. Of all the clubs I’ve been at Arsenal have banged on more than any of the others about having good technique, so that’s what I’ve taken from them. But on Sunday I’ve got a job to do for my club here and there will be no friends. “I don’t hold any grudges. I’ve already scored three goals in my last three games so I’ve got nothing to prove to Arsenal. It was their decision to sell me and I’ve moved on. It’s been years now. I’ve got great friends there, I’ve got nothing bad to say about them as a club. I would’ve liked to have got my chance but it didn’t happen. “That’s not how life works. Not everything can go your way. I believe I would’ve scored goals for them, but I’m not there any more and I don’t hold any grudges. I’m here in the Premier League scoring winners at Selhurst Park, so I’m enjoying it and I want to keep improving.” Bournemouth have excelled over recent weeks, progressing smoothly into the fifth round of the FA Cup and losing only two of their past 12 Premier League games to edge away from the bottom three and approach Arsenal’s first ever trip to Dean Court with some confidence. The belief flowing through Eddie Howe’s team has helped Afobe bridge the gap from Championship to top flight as he attempts to fill the void left by Callum Wilson’s absence with cruciate knee ligament damage. “This run is down to the boys giving me confidence before I even kicked a ball, self-belief and the manager believing in me,” added Afobe. “When you play for a manager who believes in you it gives you another 10-15%. The manager believes in me, the team believes in me. I’m just trying to improve. But when I came here I knew I was ready to make the step up. I’ve kept quiet, I haven’t said I’m going to score this or that amount of goals. I’m trying to do it quietly, I’m going to try to keep improving. If I keep doing what I do well, I’ll always give 100% for the team. “But my goalscoring is instinctive. I’ve been shooting and scoring goals since I was six and playing for Arsenal, so I don’t think you turn overnight a great goalscorer. Some people have got it. Some people haven’t. I’m not saying I’ve got it – I’m only 22 so I’m not the finished article yet – but I know how to score goals.”

After Jackson Martínez completed a whopping €42m (£32m) move from Atlético Madrid to Guangzhou Evergrande on Wednesday and with the Chinese transfer window open until 26 February, the question remains, who’s next? One man who can’t even get his bum on a bench, having been left out of his club’s 25-strong Champions League squad, and is unlikely to clamber onto it anytime soon is Radamel Falcao. The Colombian has not played for Chelsea since October due to injury and an inability to put the ball in the onion bag but will have watched Martínez’s move with interest. He shares the same agent as his compatriot, so Jorge Mendes has plenty of time to convince Jiangsu Suning, who appear to be front of the queue, that Falcao is still worth £265,000 a week. The Premier League might sneer, somewhat ironically, at the Chinese league flooding the European market with money but the goalposts are shifting. Rapidly declining strikers looking for one last payday might be the primary beneficiaries, but the Chinese clubs have identified, rather shrewdly, that they can also outspend their English counterparts to lure the very best to Asia. Liverpool’s bid of £24.6m for Alex Teixeira failed to convince Shakhtar Donetsk to sell, but Jiangsu Suning (them again) are having no such trouble. The Brazilian will sign for the Nanjing-based club in the next 24 hours for £35m, according the Mail. Listen close, reader, and you might just be able to hear the sound of a weeping Ian Ayre being comforted by Richard Scudamore, the strong silent type, watching the sun rise in the east with a thousand-yard stare. RIP Premier league, 1992-2016, you had a good run. Only joking! Kind of. It all has a knock on effect you see. Atlético plan to use the Martínez dosh to re-sign Diego Costa from Chelsea in the summer. When the question was put to the Spaniard about a return to the Vicente Calderón in December, Costa admitted in December: “You never know. Life has many turns. Look where Felipe Luis is now. I always support them.” A lack of Champions League football next season at Chelsea could be the deciding factor in that one. Another person who could depart Stamford Bridge is Asmir Begovic. The goalkeeper has reportedly become unsettled at the lack of first-team opportunities, with Thibaut Courtois unmovable as Chelsea’s No1. He should have seen that one coming, really. The 28-year-old has played only once under Guus Huddink, against Scunthorpe in the FA Cup, and Everton are willing to wave £5m in front of Roman Abramovich’s face to see if he sniffs. Victor Wanyama wants to go to Tottenham. You knew that already, didn’t you? The Kenyan has 18 months left on his contract and, while Southampton have offered him a new five-year contract, Wanyama’s refusal to sign it could force the south-coast club to sell in the summer if they don’t want to lose him on a free transfer. Elsewhere, the Turkish newspaper Sabah says Liverpool are ready to turn down £20m from Fenerbahce for Lazar Markovic. The Serb is on loan at the Istanbul club, who are keen to make the move permanent, but Jürgen Klopp seems reluctant to sell. Baffling.

Aberdeen have cause to rue what might have been. A curiously dismal league run from late September led to Derek McInnes’s team losing four out of five matches; they drew the odd one out. As they approach Wednesday evening’s meeting of Celtic, still within touching distance only six points behind the reigning champions, contentment over this position will be offset by frustration. This could be an altogether different, genuinely exciting movie, not quite on the scale of Leicester City but similar in capturing a broader public opinion. One of Celtic’s strengths in recent times has been an ability to respond after wounding events. Ronny Deila will unquestionably draw on that again, as the follow-up to a dreadful Hampden Sunday afternoon which saw Celtic bundled out of the League Cup by Ross County. This didn’t so much raise questions over Deila’s position as enhance the notion that his appointment was fundamentally flawed in the first place. Deila looks and acts like a man under pressure, a picture that has eroded the characters of better managers than him when in the Glasgow goldfish bowl. On Tuesday he insisted his “hunger” remains intact. Nobody doubts that; they have justifiable cause to doubt his ability. The basic realities of resource mean Aberdeen shouldn’t have a hope of pipping Celtic to the title. Barring something extraordinary, they still won’t. It shouldn’t so much be a basis for Deila keeping his job that the league flag is retained as a glaring case for sacking if it isn’t. And yet McInnes and his players should have neutral backing. The duopoly and occasional monopoly of Old Firm title achievement since 1985 has suffocated the Scottish game. Were this Rangers rather than Aberdeen in close pursuit of Celtic, it is obvious that excitement over a championship race would be more prevalent than is currently the case. McInnes bristles at the notion that his team have underachieved on the big stage and yet there have been frequent slipups. The return of only a League Cup from a period in which Rangers have been consigned to the Scottish game’s nether regions isn’t exactly stirring. Aberdeen haven’t made inroads in Europe, haven’t sold any players for seven-figure fees and haven’t made the most of wage resource that was last reported at £6.7m. McInnes has at least gone where so many of his predecessors could not by restoring Aberdeen to a prominent position. He has made the club an attractive prospect once again for players. And both, it must be noted, without so much as a permanent training facility. Adam Rooney has proved a wonderfully effective Scottish top-flight forward, one McInnes was willing to gamble on when others viewed the Irishman’s struggles at Birmingham City as a cause for second thoughts. The success of Danny Ward as a loanee from Liverpool will have done its part in boosting Aberdeen’s reputation as a solid grounding for emerging talent. The unavoidable big picture is that Celtic under Deila have stagnated. While that isn’t entirely the fault of the manager – the club’s recruitment process is both erratic and downsizing in nature – there is little to provide faith in regular, idealistic cliche. That Deila himself is in position, as an inexpensive project for Celtic, is a nod towards the club’s chosen approach. On the field, the consequence has been no obvious identity to the team. At best, it would be a gamble to allow Deila another attempt at taking Celtic back to the Champions League. Rumours of replacements already abound. Therein lies the dilemma for the club’s board, which has backed every element of the manager’s plan, life coaches and all, even to the recent point of altering matchday physiotherapy duties. At what point do they implement another change in direction? Deila, it must be presumed, plays at least a part in the signing of players which has seen the squad top-loaded with creative midfield players. There is a lack of bite, even nastiness, which is necessary both when stakes are raised and when going gets tough. Centre-forwards have arrived, made no impact and vanished with astonishing regularity. When Leigh Griffiths doesn’t score – to be fair, he routinely does – Celtic are ominously blunt. Deila has shown an inability to change his team’s set-up or approach mid-game. If Plan A doesn’t work, Celtic try to execute it better. Deila cannot coach bravery but he can surely impact upon the series of defensive horror shows which have undermined his tenure. The games which were supposed to endorse the 40-year-old as a capable manager still resulted ultimately in defeat to Internazionale in last season’s Europa League. This time around, Celtic looked chronically underprepared for Europe. At Pittodrie early in the campaign, Aberdeen inflicted a bloody nose on Celtic with 10 men. When the teams met again, in Glasgow, Deila’s side simply swatted their visitors aside in forceful fashion. And yet, to Aberdeen’s credit and the surprise of some onlookers, they have not gone away in the intervening months. In front of a sellout Pittodrie crowd, this is one of the Scottish season’s marquee matches. Deila needs another example of that reply to adversity, which it would be folly to rule out. Should McInnes preside over an alternative scene, perhaps Aberdeen will be taken seriously after all.

Arsène Wenger has admitted that Arsenal must qualify for the Champions League if they are to continue progressing as a club and that in previous years finishing in the top four has perhaps been taken for granted. Everton jumped above them in the Premier League at the weekend but Arsenal could move back to fourth, at least for 24 hours, if they can secure victory against West Ham at the Emirates Stadium on Tuesday. Roberto Martínez's side edged past Sunderland, while Arsenal came back from a goal down to beat Wigan Athletic on penalties in the FA Cup semi-final, a result that seemed unlikely amid frustration from supporters with 10 minutes remaining at Wembley. It is the first time since August that Arsenal have slipped out of the top four and given that Wenger has secured Champions League football for the past 16 years, the Frenchman suggested that qualifying for the tournament had become routine but is now under serious threat. Asked about the assumption that Arsenal would be a top-four side, Wenger said: "Maybe, yes, we felt anyway it was done. What will be an advantage is our desire to play in this competition because we love the Champions League and just to imagine how much we love it will help us to achieve it. "For many years I was sitting here and had to convince you that it was important that we were in the top four. Now it is in a reverse position, you say to me: 'You realise how important it is for us.' "It is vital. It is vital for the young players as well. You learn more by playing against Bayern or Barcelona or Real Madrid than if you play in the Europa League. You don't go backwards but you want to play with the top teams. It's vital to me to do it. I want this club to play in the top level competition. For that you want to be in the Champions League." Asked if his players would be motivated by the pain of potentially missing out on the competition, Wenger added: "I would like them rather to concentrate on the pleasure to be in it." Everton, who are two points clear of Arsenal with a superior goal difference, play Crystal Palace at home on Wednesday before remaining fixtures against Manchester United, Southampton, Manchester City and Hull. Arsenal play Hull at the weekend and then Newcastle, West Bromwich Albion and Norwich. Arsenal are set to welcome a number of players back in the coming days but many might not be ready to face West Ham. Laurent Koscielny could return to the heart of defence for a tussle with Andy Carroll, with the Frenchman to undergo a late fitness test following a calf problem sustained in the 6-0 defeat at Chelsea. Tomas Rosicky also faces a late test and there are significant doubts over Lukas Podolski and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, with Nacho Monreal expected to miss the game with a dead leg. Jack Wilshere will begin jogging in training this week following his hairline foot fracture and Wenger is confident the midfielder will return to action before the end of the season. Doubt still lingers over the Arsenal manager's future, given that there has been no announcement on a new contract. Wenger is still expected to sign a new deal and on Monday claimed that he is already planning for next season. "We are really focused and working very hard. Every day we spend time on that," he said. On the physical challenge expected to be posed by West Ham, 11th in the table and with safety assured, Wenger said: "It's not welcome but it doesn't matter too much who it is. If we had gone out [of the FA Cup] it would really have been terrible. The fact that we come out in a positive mood will help us to recover, I believe physically we can cope with it. "We have had a difficult schedule and the weight of a negative result, the mental aspect of a negative result in a big game, is massive. To deal with that is very difficult and when you have a succession of big games, if you lose the first one you are always in trouble. "We can finish the season well – we can finish in the top four, we can win the FA Cup – so it's down to how united we will be until the end of the season, and focused together." He said of Everton: "I believe that they have difficult games and we have difficult games but we want to focus now on what we know we can do."

Atlético Madrid How are they not exhausted yet? Atlético benefited in Europe two years ago when they faced a shattered Athletic Bilbao in the Europa League final in Bucharest, sweeping them aside 3-0, and the fear all season has been that they would suffer a collapse similar to that suffered by Marcelo Bielsa's side. The intensity isn't quite so high, but it is high enough and, with a limited squad, fatigue is a realistic concern. Until or unless it hits, though, Atlético plough on, a defensively solid side that presses intelligently, eschewing the all-out frenzy of bielsisme for something more carefully targeted – which should help to preserve energy. The basic shape is usually 4-4-2, often becoming 4-2-2-2, with Gabi and Tiago Mendes sitting deep in central midfield and a flexible front four – usually led by the muscular and prolific Diego Costa, although Atlético's performance without him Wednesday showed they are not reliant on him. The real strength, though, is probably the solidity of the back four plus Thibaut Courtois (although it seems the Belgian goalkeeper would not play if Atlético faced Chelsea so as to avoid an appearance-against-his-owners fee that was written into his loan agreement). Diego Godín has had a superb season alongside João Miranda at the heart of the defence, Juanfran is a calm and experienced right-back and Filipe is tireless on the left. In 10 Champions League games this season, Atlético have conceded only five times. Bayern Munich There is no squad in Europe more packed with talented midfielders and forwards than Bayern, no coach who sees the game quite like Pep Guardiola. To watch him in action on the touchline is to see a study in micromanagement, forever tweaking and adjusting, playing some extraordinary game of dynamic chess in which only he can see the board. If the opposition don't push men forward, he feels no need to leave men back, the result being the W-W shape he has employed at times this season, including against Manchester United on Wednesday. Critics suggest he overcomplicates the game needlessly – and the danger of shifting too many men up the pitch, quite apart from the defensive risks, is the potentially loss of verticality: if there aren't players making bursts from deep, it can be difficult to generate the sort of forward thrust necessary to puncture a blanket defence. It's certainly true that the high line Bayern play can leave them vulnerable to pace, but then the diligence of the midfield pressing tends to be enough to alleviate that. They have, after all, won 37 of 46 games under Guardiola, and a draw and two of the three defeats have come in tournaments that had already been won or after qualification for the next stage had been secured. Not only is Guardiola forever tweaking but this is a side that gives him a vast array of options: Bayern can play a far greater variety of styles than his Barcelona could. Possession, of course, is king and proactivity and ball retention are the central tenets. Within that, though, there is, to take only the most obvious example, the option of playing with a false 9 in Thomas Müller or Mario Götze or of going long to Mario Mandzukic. There may be nobody with the individual game-changing brilliance of Lionel Messi, but Bayern have plenty of ways of winning. Chelsea It may not have seemed like it at the end of the first leg of the quarter-final, when Javier Pastore wriggled through three half-challenges to score what threatened to be a decisive third goal for Paris Saint-Germain, but Chelsea vie with Atlético for the best defence of the four sides left in the competition. They also have, in José Mourinho, a manager who has that most underrated and most difficult to define of qualities, the capacity to take a fifty-fifty situation and make sure he comes out on top. Tuesday's comeback was about the players, of course, it was about indefatigability of Branislav Ivanovic, César Azpilicueta, David Luiz and Willian, Petr Cech's concentration and reflexes, the scurrying and imagination of Oscar, the general solidity of Gary Cahill and John Terry, but it was also about the preparation, tactical and mental, of Mourinho, and about his capacity to transmit his ferocious will to win to his players. Mourinho knows his side don't have the attacking strength to take on an opponent at this level in an open fight but he relishes the opportunity to execute a gameplan to prevent opponents from playing and, in Eden Hazard, Willian, André Schürrle and Oscar, he has the ideal creative midfielders to play on the counter, sitting deep and springing forward on the counterattack at pace. Real Madrid What had been apparent in the clásico was just as evident against Borussia Dortmund in the quarter-final. Across their forward line, this Real Madrid side are as dynamic as any team probably ever, Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale offering a very modern blend of technical ability, pace and explosive strength, while having in Karim Benzema a forward whose willingness to drop deep makes him an ideal foil. Few sides would fancy their chances of holding off Real Madrid. The problem is at the other end. Although the midfield three of Xabi Alonso, Luka Modric and Ángel di María are capable of controlling possession rather better than Madrid sides have in recent years, the deficiencies behind them mean they can still be overwhelmed. The lack of width is inherent in the 4-3-3 but it is exacerbated by the lack of tracking done by Ronaldo (and to a lesser extent Bale). For a full-back to leave either and surge forwards is an enormous gamble, of course, and Di María works as manfully to fill the gap as anybody could reasonably expect, but any full-back who does dare venture into the Madrid half is likely to find himself almost untended, particularly if Di María is occupied dealing with a midfielder. Add to that Marcelo's shortcomings as a defender and the Madrid left, while a great strength from an attacking point of view, is a vulnerability.

Not for the first time, Liverpool could be grateful to Steven Gerrard for his nerveless precision from the spot. The captain scored his 10th and 11th penalties of the season in all competitions as his club maintained their Premier League title challenge and made light of a remarkable refereeing blunder into the bargain. One of the principal talking points of a dramatic afternoon came at the end of the first half when Andy Carroll, West Ham's former Liverpool striker, who was on a mission to prove and score points against his old side, clouted the visiting goalkeeper, Simon Mignolet, following Mark Noble's corner. Guy Demel duly flicked home his first goal in West Ham colours but the linesman, Stuart Burt, was flagging. The goal looked set to be disallowed. Yet, after a lengthy conversation with Burt, the referee, Anthony Taylor, overruled him. West Ham were level. Taylor happens to hail from Manchester; cue Liverpudlian conspiracies. Gerrard, however, cut through them when he blasted in the second penalty and it was West Ham that were left to spit the feathers over the other big discussion point even if, on balance, Liverpool were value for the victory. Despite a disciplined performance, West Ham did not do enough in the final third. The home side's manager Sam Allardyce and everybody with West Ham in their hearts – or, indeed, Chelsea and Manchester City – could not believe that Taylor chose to penalise Adrián, the West Ham goalkeeper, for bringing down Jon Flanagan, after the Liverpool full-back had nicked the ball in front of him inside the area. It was a close call and Brendan Rodgers, the Liverpool manager, admitted that it was one of those which tended to feel a "wee bit contentious" when they went against you. Rodgers also suggested that Taylor was "chasing the game" after the controversy of the West Ham equaliser. Adrián did make contact with the ball as the players initially came together but, as Flanagan continued to try to reach it, the goalkeeper grabbed at his foot. The arguments raged at the time and long into the night while there were boos from the Upton Park crowd at the final whistle. Allardyce's anger was fuelled, in part, by the fact that a committed performance had yielded nothing; West Ham did carry the fight to Liverpool, particularly in the first half. But Allardyce appeared to undermine his arguments about injustice when he agreed that Demel's equaliser ought not to have stood. He seemed more preoccupied with simply complaining about the officials. This was not a vintage performance from Liverpool, even if they looked better after Rodgers switched from 4-3-3 to a diamond midfield at half-time. They only cut loose in an attacking sense after Gerrard's second penalty but it was nevertheless a ninth consecutive league victory and the excitement around the club, as they eye a first championship since 1990, is palpable. The visit of City to Anfield next Sunday has all the hallmarks of a title decider and it was interesting to hear Rodgers lay the psychological groundwork, when he talked of the money that City had spent in order to win the league and the Champions League. But his team, as he acknowledged, is playing without any inhibitions. This was a gutsy win, in which West Ham's physical power had to be contained, and it came not only from Carroll but Mohamed Diamé, who drove inside from the flank, and the central defenders, Winston Reid and James Tomkins. Carroll's duel with Martin Skrtel was box-office stuff. Liverpool were content to punch on the counter, to harness the pace and quicksilver quality in their ranks and they flickered, mainly through Luis Suárez. The opening goal came on the break, following a direct ball from Gerrard and Suárez was central to it. Tomkins had played him well up to that point, even if the Uruguayan had managed to wriggle clear of the West Ham defence to bend a 20th-minute shot against the crossbar, but the home team did not escape when he darted on to Gerrard's pass and touched inside Tomkins. The defender left his hand out, the ball struck it and it was an obvious award. Up stepped Gerrard and up flashed the Sky TV graphic on both of the stadium's big screens about where the Liverpool captain had placed his most recent penalties, which was weird, even if Adrián surely had to be pre-armed with that kind of information. Gerrard still sent him the wrong way, planting the kick low into the bottom right-hand corner. West Ham fought back. Literally. It felt inconceivable that Taylor could not see Carroll leading with his arm to clump Mignolet on the head but Demel's goal would stand. Carroll almost got the goal he craved on 61 minutes only for his header from Diamé's cross to thump against the crossbar and the game turned again on the second penalty, which Gerrard hammered into the other corner. Liverpool might have embellished the final scoreline. Suárez hit the crossbar again with an impudent chip while he was also denied one-on-one by Adrián and the goalkeeper saved smartly from Raheem Sterling. Liverpool roll on.

The Europa League could now beckon for Arsenal. This doomsday scenario is a reality because with this win Everton confirmed Arsène Wenger's team are in a potentially fatal late-season tailspin. The record shows no win since 16 March and only two points from four outings for the Gunners, who have never failed to qualify for the Champions League in every full season of Wenger's 16-year reign. The momentum is with Everton who are a point a behind and have a match in hand. If Roberto Martínez's bright, attacking side defeat Sunderland next Saturday they will move ahead of Arsenal, who are at Wembley to take on Wigan Athletic in an FA Cup semi-final. The 90 minutes here belied the Frenchman's description of the contest. Arsenal's manager had branded it a six-pointer. It suggested the spoils could go either way. In truth, Everton schooled Arsenal with a lesson that made Wenger appear the student manager and Martínez the man with a 1,003 games on his club CV. The move that created the opener was an illustration of many of the telling differences between the philosophies espoused by the Spaniard and Wenger. From a left channel where he wreaked havoc all day, Leighton Baines hit an instant pass behind the visiting defence. Romelu Lukaku's shot at Wojciech Szczesny rebounded to Steven Naismith, and the Scotland forwward rolled the finish home. The pace of this sequence was what killed Arsenal. Martínez may like the slick and pretty stuff but it comes with power and an end-product. Wenger's ethos remains to over-complicate. When Lukas Podolski and Mathieu Flamini were not taking 20-yard pot-shots at Tim Howard, one of Wenger's men was turning yet again into traffic to stymie any openings. Lukaku's goal was all of this in microcosm. The Belgian forward, playing on the right of Everton's 4-3-3, collected possession near halfway. No second thought fogged intent as he set off on a buccaneering run that removed Nacho Monreal before cutting inside towards the area to lash home a memorable 13th of the season. Time and again Everton undid Arsenal by spinning the ball out wide to reach the last third with dizzying speed. On this display, why David Moyes was so keen to take Baines to Manchester United is evident. The left-back was the focus of much of Everton's attack, as when Ross Barkley sliced open Arsenal's defence with a pass that put his fellow England man in and – once more – the ball was whipped over instantly. Before Lukaku's goal a quick pass from Bacary Sagna on the right that Olivier Giroud might have profited from was a rare instance of Arsenal posing Everton a serious question. Martínez's men came into the match having won their previous five league games. The manager said: "We have worked really hard all season to be able to get ourselves in this position and now we are facing the final seven games with a real desire to get as many points as we can. We all know that to beat a team like Arsenal we will have to be perfect in what we want to do." After the interval the early signs were that Wenger had informed his charges to step it up, as Monreal galloped into space left by Seamus Coleman, who had been dragged inside, but the cross found no one. This proved false hope for Arsenal as they faded into the role of patsies again. The hunger that drove Kevin Mirallas towards the loose ball and caused Mikel Arteta to turn past Szczesny for the Everton third encapsulated the gulf in quality – and desire – on show. Martínez has all of his players singing the same tune. At 36 and on an eighth club Sylvain Distin, who was barely troubled, is enjoying this new song. "For a player like me who is used to being more of a stopper it wasn't enjoyable for the first few months and I was a bit scared at first," the defender said. "The manager would be telling me I had to get the ball here and there instead of being a bit more old-fashioned. But it is enjoyable now because it works. We are in a good position and it is very easy. I enjoy it at the moment." Arsenal's closing fixtures comprise West Ham United, Hull City, Newcastle United, West Bromwich Albion and Norwich City, none of whom are the division's big guns. Everton have still to host Manchester United and Manchester City. This run-in could yet save the Gunners. But do not count on it.

Not quite one to garner the attention of purists. Avoiding defeat is a must to keep Cardiff in with a chance of surviving but Crystal Palace will look to frustrate the hosts. And after last week's victory at home to Chelsea, Tony Pulis's team will be confident of a first win in 10 at Cardiff. They are not yet safe but a win would go a long way to securing their status and put Cardiff on the brink.

Man of the day Kelechi Iheanacho scored three for City, bringing his tally for the season to nine. He has started five games . Goals of the day His side may have lost, but Lewis McGugan’s two for Sheffield Wednesday at Shrewsbury were special – his second in particular. Spat of the day After being beaten, at least Plymouth took it well. “Wycombe came here to waste time, niggle and get under our skin,” they tweeted. “They did it and they won.” @wwfcofficial straight-batted their reply: “Well played and thanks for having us.” Still got it Barry Richardson, Wycombe’s 46-year-old goalkeeping coach, came off the bench after 15 minutes against Plymouth for his first game in 11 years. He kept a clean sheet in a 1-0 win, having spent the pre-match warm-up drinking tea. Cameo of the day A Woking fan – gamely stepping up as a replacement fourth official after a linesman suffered a first-half ball to the face. The fan took up the role after a PA announcement asked for qualified volunteers; the match resumed after a 15-minute delay. Grudge of the day When Fabian Delph decided to quit Villa for City last summer, then did a U-turn and pledged his loyalty, then did a double U-turn and left, Villa fans dubbed him “a snake”. Yesterday one fan went to special lengths to remind him, brandishing an inflable serpent. Sweetest revenge Sheffield Wednesday beat Fulham in the third round, but their FA Cup ended in the fourth round when Jack Grimmer scored a winner for Shrewsbury in the seventh added minute. Grimmer is on loan from … Fulham. Chutzpah of the day You have to admire the cool dedication to autograph-hunting of the Colchester fan who ran on to the pitch to get his programme signed mid-match. Michel Vorm shrugged him off. Tribute of the day Cheltenham’s big-scoring No9 Danny Wright scored twice against Bromley – a fine way to celebrate last month’s birth of his new son – full name: Ronny 9 Wright. Plus: stat of the day Leo Messi’s goal against Atlético Madrid was the 1,000th that he and Cristiano Ronaldo have scored between them.

Tim Sherwood came out fighting on Monday night despite facing the sack as Tottenham Hotspur's manager at the end of the season, claiming after a 5-1 thumping of Sunderland that "nothing has changed" at the club and that he is still planning for the long term. The Holland coach, Louis van Gaal, and Southampton's manager, Mauricio Pochettino, are the frontrunners for the Spurs job but Sherwood denied he had held talks with the chairman, Daniel Levy, about departing. Levy was not at White Hart Lane to watch an impressive win, during which Sherwood appeared bullish on the touchline, and afterwards the manager pointed out that he has a better win percentage in the Premier League than any of his predecessors at Tottenham. The club said discussions with Sherwood would be held at the end of the season. There are also question marks over the future of Franco Baldini, the Tottenham director of football, given the lack of success enjoyed by the plethora of expensive summer signings made last year in the wake of Gareth Bale's sale to Real Madrid. "We had a chat about next season, there are players I've identified and we've talked about pre-season," Sherwood said. "Nothing has changed. It [the speculation] doesn't affect me. I've got an opportunity to manage this club and I owe it to the players and fans to do the job professionally. "I don't think it does anyone any favours, but you just get on with it. All I was focused on was winning the game tonight, preparing the boys correctly and being professional. It has been an opportunity to manage this great club and I'm relishing it. My record has been very good; in the Premier League it has been second to none. In the Premier League, of any manager that has been here, my win percentage is higher than anyone." Asked if the club were entitled to consider other managerial options for next season, he added: "Clubs always look for the next one. It's like with players. Always look for someone to come in and replace the player. I don't know if this club's been doing that. Any questions regarding my employment you'll have to ask my employers." Sherwood signed an 18-month contract with Tottenham in December after the departure of André Villas-Boas but, despite impressive wins away from home against Manchester United, Swansea and Newcastle, the club have dropped out of contention for a top-four place. Spurs are five points behind Arsenal, who occupy the final Champions League place, but Sherwood denied being given a directive by Levy when taking the managerial reins that finishing in the top four was paramount to his future at the club. "No, not at all. There was never any talk about that. Obviously we wanted Champions League football but there was never any pressure or talk about having to finish in the Champions League. You just go out and do your best. " They made the decision that they wanted to make a change and they asked me if I would like the opportunity [to be manager]. I said: 'If it was right for me' and that's where we are now. I'm doing my best in every game and I will continue to do that until the end." Asked if he believed he was the best man for Tottenham in the long term, Sherwood joked: "I'm the best manager this club has ever seen." Spurs cruised to a comfortable victory despite conceding an early lead against Sunderland, with Emmanuel Adebayor scoring twice. The Togo forward, who has thrived under Sherwood this season, said he hoped the former midfielder would remain at the club beyond the summer. Adebayor said: "No matter what happens to the manager, I respect him. I'm very happy to be back on the pitch again, scoring goals and playing alongside [Christian] Eriksen, who is a great player, and we are just enjoying ourselves. "I am playing, I am scoring goals, so I hope he stays, but I'm not the chairman, I'm not the owner of the club, so no matter what happens as a professional footballer I just have to do my job for the club and keep focused and keep doing what I love most: scoring goals. "But I was thinking about him in my head and he has done a big thing in my life. When everyone forgot about me, he gave me back my life, so I'm very grateful and I want to say a big thanks to him."

Chelsea cannot afford to dwell on either their midweek defeat in Paris, or for that matter their loss at Crystal Palace seven days ago. A team that looked strong for so long are suddenly faltering on all fronts but this match offers José Mourinho's men a chance to at least re-establish themselves in the Premier League. Worryingly for the home side, they face a Stoke side in good form.

Liverpool, Man United, Chelsea and Arsenal: Norwich's run-in is unenviable, making this and next week's trip to Fulham hugely important. Six points clear of the drop, a win over an increasingly desperate West Brom would put them in a good position. Norwich's home form is strong, with an unbeaten run stretching back to December, while West Brom's only win under Pepe Mel came on the road. Defeat for Albion will increase their fears.

At the end of this game the Borussia Dortmund coach, Jürgen Klopp, was asked if he thought there was a chance of his side turning the tie around after Real Madrid had completed their first-leg victory. The reply was eloquent: "Do you think I am an idiot?" he said. "We lost 3-0 and now we have to shut up. This is not a situation for hope or big speeches." Even a repeat of last May's 4-1 home semi-final win for Dortmund would not be enough to derail Real now and their Bundesliga opponents on Wednesday night are not the team that reached the 2013 final. Only four of the 11 starters from that night at Wembley were included here: the injury list is long, Mario Götze departed for Bayern Munich and Robert Lewandowski, scorer of all four goals, was suspended, although he will be back for the second leg. Marco Reus was as dangerous as he was alone – he must have looked around and wondered where the team he used to play with has gone. Yet even then Klopp admitted that his team on Wednesday should have done better. As for Real, they have added the world's most expensive player, Gareth Bale, and they continue to progress smoothly through this competition. This was their eighth win in nine games, secured with goals from Bale, Isco and Cristiano Ronaldo, and although they were under pressure in the second half, by then their lead was large and the task before their opponents even larger. Their only concern was the sight of Ronaldo departing late on. Real had been in the lead almost from the start. The clock showed just 2min 58sec when they scored. Karim Benzema, Dani Carvajal and Bale loaded the right side, arriving in stages like an unfolding attack in rugby. Benzema played a sideways pass to Carvajal who fed Bale and, running in, he nudged the ball past Roman Weidenfeller for his fifth Champions League goal for Real. "It was too easy," Klopp said. "Two against one on the wing and two against none in the area." A second goal seemed to be a question of when, not if. Ronaldo was crowded out, Isco's shot was blocked and Bale found the net again, only for it to be ruled out for offside. Ronaldo had one long-range effort palmed away, a free-kick pushed over and a volley blocked. Pepe's header was cleared off the line. The game was quarter of an hour in. Dortmund could not escape; Real sensed weakness. Soon Bale too came close with a free-kick, Weidenfeller making another excellent save. Just as Dortmund seemed to have recovered, they went 2-0 down, Isco curling a shot into the bottom corner from 18 yards. And at the point when the visitors had regained composure after that setback they went further behind. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Reus combined well on the left, but the striker shot weakly. He wasted another chance soon after and then Madrid scored. Luka Modric found Ronaldo and he equalled Lionel Messi's record of 14 Champions League goals in a single season, rolling the ball home after a neat shuffle of the feet. Dortmund attacked more and more but to no avail. "How many chances did we have, four or five?" Klopp asked. "But when you're 3-0 down you're not cool and not confident; you're under pressure and you don't take your chances." Pepe made one superb challenge and Iker Casillas reacted extremely fast to make a save the linesman's flag rendered redundant. Both times, Reus was denied. But while Dortmund sought the away goal, they knew a place in the semi-final was slipping away. At the other end there were chances too, including a long run from Bale that ended with him shooting over, but no more goals. Three were enough for Real.

Barcelona and Atlético Madrid's chances of silverware have been dealt potentially devastating blows after they lost key players to injury in Tuesday's Champions League match, with the home side's centre-back Gerard Piqué damaging a hip and the visitors' top scorer Diego Costa limping off with what appeared to be a hamstring strain. Barça said Piqué would be out for around four weeks while Costa, who was doubtful for the match with a groin injury, will need more tests to determine how long he will be out of action. He told AS that he would be out of the second leg, saying: "The second leg? I won't make it." Atlético said on their Twitter feed that tests had revealed a muscle strain instead of a tear. The club did not specify how long he might be out of action. Piqué will miss next Wednesday's second leg in Madrid, the King's Cup final against Real Madrid on 16 April and several La Liga games. He may also have to sit out the two-legged Champions League semi-final at the end of the month if Barça qualify. His absence leaves Barça seriously weakened at the back. Their creaking captain Carles Puyol has missed most of the season with injuries and has been as good as permanently replaced by a defensive midfielder, Javier Mascherano, while Barça had to call on a 23-year-old academy graduate, Marc Bartra, to replace Piqué. Meanwhile Atlético are heavily dependent on Costa's goals, 25 in the league (more than a third of their total) and seven in the Champions League, and face a struggle to hold on to top spot in the table. They last won La Liga in 1996 with a team featuring Simeone, but are just a point clear of Barça with seven games left and their final match is another trip to the Camp Nou. The door could now be re-opened to Real Madrid, who lie third, three points behind their city rivals, having faltered recently in the league. Piqué, whose Spain international team-mate and goalkeeper Victor Valdés was ruled out for seven months this week after he tore knee ligaments, had to be replaced by Bartra after only 12 minutes when he landed awkwardly after jumping for the ball. The game ended 1-1 after goals from Costa's replacement Diego and Barça's Neymar. The Atlético coach, Diego Simeone, said Costa would need more tests to determine the extent of the injury with Raúl Garcia, David Villa or Adrian ready to stand in for the Spain international. "In these situations the best thing is to be able to count on all the players in the squad," Martino said. "Bartra did very well, he was very precise. I was not surprised. He is a centre-back with a lot of qualities. What I was surprised by was how quickly he adapted to the game almost without having warmed up. He did it with a lot of personality." It was the fourth stalemate between the Spanish rivals this term after they drew 1-1 and 0-0 in the two-legged, season-opening Spanish Super Cup and 0-0 in La Liga in January. Simeone said: "We have a team with huge heart and it made me so happy to be able to compete against these opponents. From a tactical point of view, it was a beautiful game. Both teams played to their strengths and stayed true to their style."

Chelsea's title challenge has run aground south of the river. This derby was supposed to be awkward rather than treacherous but, eclipsed by Crystal Palace's sheer refusal to wilt, the side who had led going into the weekend ended up feeling forlorn. José Mourinho strode from the pitch consoling a distraught Gary Cahill, one of the few visiting players to deserve better, and straight into the home dressing room to congratulate the victors. This was a result to confound logic even in a gloriously unpredictable top flight. Palace had secured a solitary point from 14 games against the Premier League's top nine before this match, their winless streak stretching back to the start of February with goals having long since dried up. They had not managed one from open play since that last success though, befitting a contest that deviated from the prescribed script, Chelsea scored one for them here. John Terry's own goal early in the second half had Mourinho writing off his team's chances of regaining the title. He scribbled one word down on a piece of paper, preferring not to damn his own out loud, when asked what his team needs if they are to improve. "Balls," read the note. That summed it up. This was as weak from Chelsea as it was powerful from Palace. The hosts had resisted through the early stages, emulating their rugged first-half displays against Manchester United and Arsenal here this season, and even mustered a flurry of half-chances just before the interval to offer a reminder they might glean greater reward thereafter. Seven minutes after the restart and their endeavours were answered. The excellent Joel Ward, fed by Yannick Bolasie's pass, summoned a fine cross towards Joe Ledley at the near post only for the Chelsea captain to leap in aerial challenge and flick the ball beyond a stranded Petr Cech. Selhurst Park erupted, the din merely fuelling the home side's conviction. They would go on to miss clearer chances on the counter-attack, striking the post through Cameron Jerome, as their opponents became desperate. It was the reality that few had seen this coming that took the breath away. Palace have been industrious since Tony Pulis's arrival but had remained ineffective, even blunt, against the division's better opposition. Indeed, theirs had started to feel like a steady decline towards the cut-off. Yet here they countered with verve and threat, and defended with such energy. "Our results had dropped off, even if the performances had been OK, but to beat Chelsea will give everyone a boost to push on for the last seven games," said Pulis. "The Premier League is the most competitive in the world. The top teams have to play well or they can come unstuck." Chelsea endured just that, the repercussions of failure critical. Mourinho bemoaned some of his key performers having "disappeared" in certain matches, when opponents have pressed and harried as Palace did so effectively. The same had happened, he suggested, in all their league defeats this term bar the loss at Aston Villa in their previous away game that he will always insist was born of a freakishly poor performance from the referee. Certainly, key players were anonymous. Fernando Torres's sole contribution of note was to lift a lob over a gaping net as full-time approached, the striker having been carelessly gifted possession by Stuart O'Keefe. Furious occasions such as this tend to pass the Spaniard by and, other than that chance, he never represented a threat in the area. Yet he was not alone in fluffing his lines. André Schürrle was thwarted at his clearest sight of goal by Ward's lunge, the ball dribbling wide, but none of the visitors' forwards had the bite to make their mark. Even Eden Hazard was peripheral for long periods, briefly rousing himself to curl a wicked shot through a clutch of bodies just after Terry's error that Julian Speroni did well to palm away. The Argentinian has been consistently impressive as one of the division's busier goalkeepers and he managed to better that save with another from the Belgian before the end, Oscar's choked shot having landed at Hazard's feet. The din that greeted the save almost matched the one that heralded the home side's lead. There were anxious moments before the end, Chelsea flinging bodies forward in search of parity only to be caught too often on the break with Palace, somehow, contriving to miss a succession of chances to settle the match. Mourinho's words of advice with a ballboy he considered to have been time-wasting added to the drama, though the final whistle, after four minutes of stoppage time, brought relief. Not since Ian Wright's lob in the autumn of 1990 had Palace won against these opponents in the league. "For their spirit, their commitment, their desire, they deserved it," Mourinho said. "This is the kind of defeat where we can only blame ourselves."

At the final whistle Steven Gerrard was on his haunches. All around him there were Liverpool players in a state of shock, some falling to the turf, others just wandering aimlessly. Luis Suárez's shirt had been pulled over his face, trying to hide the tears, and Gerrard was pushing away the television cameras while trying to keep in his own emotions. They were a broken lot. At one point, shortly after Suárez had given them a 3-0 lead, a loud cry had gone up from the Liverpool end of "We're going to win the league". Their team had looked like worthy champions and were actually in the process of trying to chase down Manchester City's superior goal difference. What happened next was almost inexplicable but there is also an inescapable truth to the night that surely confirmed Liverpool had thrown away any last chance of winning the league. It is that a team with serious aspirations of finishing the season with a championship trophy cannot get away with being this generous in defence. Liverpool's back four crumpled in a way that undermined all their attacking brilliance. It is, loosely speaking, the fundamental reason why their title challenge will almost certainly come up short and what a remarkable late passage of play that was from a Crystal Palace side that had looked suspiciously in end-of-season mode for three quarters of this match. For long spells Liverpool had made them resemble the vulnerable, slightly dishevelled team that Tony Pulis had inherited in October. Joe Allen's 18th-minute header had put Liverpool in a position of command and they were not far off rampant when Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suárez scored within two minutes of each other in the early stages of the second half. After each goal Liverpool's players could be seen rushing to get the ball out of the net and sprinting back to the centre circle, desperate not to waste any time as they sought more goals. "Attack, attack, attack" was the cry in Liverpudlian accents. Realistically, it was always futile to think they could claw back the goal difference that had established Manchester City as favourites for the league. Yet it is almost inexplicable how this vibrant display of attacking football ended in trauma and shock. Damien Delaney set it in motion, almost out of nowhere, with a 20-yard shot that deflected off Glen Johnson to find the top corner. Yannick Bolasie's brilliant run on the left set up the substitute Dwight Gayle in virtually the next attack and then the same player completed the comeback after Glenn Murray had split open the Liverpool defence yet again. Three goals had arrived in 10 minutes and, though Liverpool desperately tried to add another twist, the damage was grievous. For a few seconds Brendan Rodgers just closed his eyes. "We got carried away," he said afterwards. "We thought we could score more and we lost our defensive structure." Naivety, to put it another way. Rodgers accepted that the title was surely heading to Manchester but the players had already done that without even speaking. Martin Skrtel was on the floor, pulling his fingers down his face. Gerrard went to comfort Suárez. In the end Kolo Touré, an unused substitute, led the striker off the pitch. To a man, it was a picture of sporting desolation. It was a barely credible finale and what a stunning effort from Palace, completely out of keeping with the way the rest of the game had gone. "We didn't give them a sniff," Rodgers said, which was not exactly the case but not too far off. Liverpool's goalkeeper, Simon Mignolet, had little to do in the first half, bar save a couple of long-range efforts from Jason Puncheon and Mile Jedinak. That apart, Liverpool's No1 was barely threatened until those late, dramatic moments when everything unravelled. Pulis has based Palace's resurgence on qualities of structure and resilience but there was something disjointed about their defending at times. Allen, hardly a player known for his aerial prowess, headed in the opening goal, direct from Gerrard's corner. Sturridge made it 2-0 when he took down Gerrard's long pass, turned inside Joel Ward and his shot took a slight, yet decisive, flick off Delaney. Then Suárez's goal came from a one-two with Raheem Sterling and that was the point when Liverpool's fans started their victory songs. Totting up the number of chances they created, there was something implausible about the ordeal. Yet Gayle took his goals with great expertise and, remarkably, Palace had a couple of half-chances to win the match. As it was, it seemed almost irrelevant that Liverpool had gone back to the top of the league. City will leapfrog them again by beating, or even drawing against, Aston Villa on Wednesday/ and then have another home game, against West Ham, when it would need something extraordinary to prevent them winning their second championship in three seasons. For Liverpool the tears were flowing in the stands and on the pitch. They knew it was over.

Ashley Cole fears he has played his last game for Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, with the England full-back still to receive a formal offer of a new contract from the club he has served for the last eight years. The 33-year-old was in tears during the squad's lap of appreciation after the goalless draw with Norwich on Sunday, his emotion betraying the reality that he may move on in the summer. Chelsea have indicated they will take their time before formalising any offer but the lack of a preliminary proposal has left the left-back fearing the worst. There will be interest from clubs home and abroad in securing his services, with Real Madrid – managed by Carlo Ancelotti and assisted by Paul Clement, who coached Cole at Chelsea – as well as Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco monitoring the situation, along with teams in Major League Soccer. Those clubs have had the opportunity to sign the defender on a pre-contract agreement since January, though the former Arsenal man's priority had been to stay. He might yet consider retirement should no offer materialise, especially if he goes on to feature for England in a record fourth World Cup finals this summer. The Chelsea manager, José Mourinho, suggested on Sunday that the club intend to take stock over the next few weeks before determining the futures of Cole, Frank Lampard and John Terry, who are also out of contract on 30 June. Lampard is expected to sign a one-year deal on reduced terms and may work towards taking a role among the coaching staff at Cobham. Terry is also expected to stay but after initial negotiations over a new deal his representatives have heard nothing back from Chelsea for a month. That has prompted some anxiety with the 33-year-old captain, who has been at the club since his early teens and has just enjoyed one of the most consistent seasons of his career, on tenterhooks. Terry used his programme notes for the Norwich game to demonstrate his appreciation for the support he has received from the fans over the years and, while falling short of a clear farewell, his words could have been construed as the precursor to a parting of ways. "I want to say a big thank you for always showing me massive support on and off the field," he wrote. "It was my dream when I arrived at 14 to go on and do what I've done."

Wojciech Szczesny has voiced frustration at Arsenal's inability to sustain a title challenge this season but he believes the squad will gain from their experience and, if further additions are made, will pose a greater threat next term. Arsène Wenger's side can claim their first trophy in nine years if they overcome Hull City in the FA Cup final on Saturday 17 May, though the fact their challenge for the Premier League rather fizzled out in the new year is a source of disappointment. Arsenal topped the table for 128 days, the most of any of the contenders, but will end the season in fourth place. The prospect of a 17th successive season of Champions League football provides a considerable consolation but there is a sense of what might have been. "With two games to go we had nothing to play for and we shouldn't really be in that position," said Szczesny in the wake of Sunday's home victory against West Bromwich Albion. "We should be fighting for the title. I believe we should be in a position to challenge to win the Premier League. But we dropped some important points and lost games and had a new challenge, to finish fourth when we weren't probably the favourites to do that. At least we managed to do that for our fans and hopefully we'll manage to get the FA Cup for them. "I never considered fourth place before the start of the season as a successful season and a good position. I play for Arsenal because I want to win the title every year. Obviously, at some point, when you lose games and you lose the chance to fight for the title, then the new challenge is to secure the Champions League spot and that was the aim this season but I wouldn't have taken it last summer." Szczesny pointed to untimely injuries suffered by Aaron Ramsey – who had enjoyed his most productive form for the club until being ruled out from Boxing Day through to April – and Mesut Özil as having checked the team's progress. "Obviously it made a difference," he said. "You could see when Mesut and Aaron came back recently we started winning games and we looked a completely different team. We've had a bit of bad luck but I believe we had a squad strong enough to challenge anyway. "We have improved, so that's one thing we have learned. The squad is stronger and everyone can say the squad was strong enough to challenge for the title. It didn't happen for us this year but one thing we have learned is that we are good enough to challenge next year, and hopefully add a little bit more strength as well with a couple of new players coming in. Hopefully we will be stronger and, if we manage to keep the consistency for the whole season, we'll be up there." The Poland goalkeeper, who is established as Arsenal's first choice, still hopes to feature in the showpiece at Wembley against Hull despite his compatriot, Lukasz Fabianski, having been the team's regular in the FA Cup this season. "I speak with Lukasz but I haven't spoken to the boss about it," said Szczesny. "There's no banter [with Lukasz]. Look, we're both professional and we would both love to play in the Cup final. "It's the boss's decision to make, not an easy one, because there is a No1 at the club and a goalkeeper who is the reason we are in the FA Cup final. I think Lukasz has done so well that he deserves to play but, having said that, I'm a professional and I would love to play in the Cup final."

Manchester City survived a few nervy moments late in the second half but came through their testat Everton, and Manuel Pellegrini urged supporters to put the title celebrations on hold until both the remaining games have been won. City still need to take maximum points from home games against Aston Villa and West Ham, or at least do better than Liverpool, and although there was relief at the end at Goodison their manager stressed that nothing has been won yet. "The worst thing we could do is believe that today we won the Premier League title," Pellegrini said. "We still have two games to play against teams with nothing to fight for, who can come to our stadium and play without pressure." Pellegrini accepted City were not at their best, partly due to losing Sergio Agüero to injury during the game and taking off Yaya Touré as a precaution, but said three points were all that mattered. "The most important thing was to win," he said. "We defended well, scored three goals and came back from a goal down. It was not easy, but we managed the game." Agüero may now miss the rest of the domestic season, in which case his equalising goal on 22 minutes could be as important as his last-gasp winner against QPR in the final game two years ago. Pellegrini revealed he indicated to the bench that he had a problem before he scored, but said he would try to play on. He may even have aggravated the strain when scoring with a powerful shot. "He told me his leg felt strange but he would try to continue," Pellegrini said. "I don't know if we will see him again this season – we will find out more tomorrow – but although he was only on the field a short time he scored a very important goal for the team."

For Arsenal, there is reassurance and no little credit in the familiar. Their membership of Europe's most exclusive football club has been renewed. For the 17th consecutive season, they have qualified for the Champions League, even if they will need a seventh play-off in nine years to make it to the group phase. Arsenal knew that a fourth-placed Premier League finish was secure before West Bromwich Albion rolled into town, thanks to Manchester City's defeat of Everton on Saturday and there was an end-of-season feel to the proceedings on their side, if not that of the visitors. The most uplifting moment came after the post-match lap of appreciation to mark the club's final home game, when Bacary Sagna's little boy dribbled the length of the field and, to huge smiles and cheers from the crowd, banged a ball that looked almost as big as him into the net. Mikel Arteta's son followed suit to prove that Arsenal do have end product. The lap from the players and their children was notable for the plaintive cries from the home support towards Sagna Sr. They want him to stay, rather than depart on a Bosman free transfer, and they told him so again and again. But as omens went, the sight of him asking the club photographer to take a snap of him with his wife and two children on the Emirates Stadium pitch did not look too positive. There was rather less of a clamour for Arsène Wenger to sign his new contract and stay but maybe it is because the fans know that he will do so. The manager has given his word on many occasions and he was at it again here. "I told you many times," Wenger said. "My word is my word and I'm from an ancestral period where you didn't need a pen to commit." That got a laugh, although his reasons for waiting and waiting, for dragging this saga until the very last, possibly beyond even the FA Cup final, in which Arsenal will face Hull City, continued to baffle. There was, however, a clue. "It's not linked with the FA Cup at all [but] it was, of course, important to be in the Champions League," Wenger said. The path to the quill and ink is now surely clear. "I have [had] no moments of doubt," Wenger added. "If I had moments of doubt, they would have been a few years ago when I had to say 'no' to many offers, and I committed to this club under a lot of pressure." The afternoon became a discussion for Arsenal fans about whether their glasses were half-full or half-empty. They had been in title contention until the visit to Chelsea on 22 March and so in one sense, the top-four place – the bare minimum requirement of the season – has failed to quicken the pulses. Wenger lamented again how the campaign had been scarred by the high-profile away-day drubbings, most gruesomely the 6-0 at Stamford Bridge, which reignited all of those questions about Arsenal's knowhow. But Champions League qualification is not something to be sniffed at and Wenger can make a case for having overseen progress. Arsenal have, at least, competed for the title and if they win the FA Cup, they will be able to sell it as a positive season. Much still rests on the final. It was a more important day for Albion, given the fight to preserve their Premier League status and their first-half performance, in particular, was a worry. They conceded when Craig Dawson failed to contain Olivier Giroud on Santi Cazorla's corner and the striker headed his 22nd goal of the season. The visitors were slightly better in the second half and Wojciech Szczesny had to block from Morgan Amalfitano in the 72nd minute but Arsenal always looked comfortable. With Mesut Özil a threat, they created the better chances and Lukas Podolski sliced against the post on 76 minutes. Albion could celebrate in the end when Norwich City's failure to win at Chelsea ensured their survival but the manager Pepe Mel did not inspire much optimism, either with regard to his future or that of the club. He said he would discuss whether he would stay for another year after the final game at home to Stoke City while he mentioned again the dozen or so players that will be out of contract in the summer. "West Brom has a lot of work to do," Mel said. Man of the match Mesut Özil (Arsenal)

Alan Pardew had predicted that one manager would be "very unhappy" by the final whistle but instead there were two men holding back the tears on Saturday. While Cardiff's Ole Gunnar Solskjaer suffered the agony of relegation, victories can rarely have proved more hollow for his crestfallen Newcastle United counterpart. A few thousand home fans walked out in disgust during the second half, there were repeated calls for Pardew's head and he spent most of the afternoon in his dugout. The mood was so edgy, sullen, unpleasant and thoroughly strange that it is extremely hard to believe he can survive as Newcastle's manager after this. On a day when Cardiff raged valiantly against the dying of their Premier League light, creating a litany of chances Solskjaer's players could not quite convert, Pardew's team halted a run of six straight defeats but failed to convince. In the stands months of festering resentment against his management style – the biggest complaints are that Pardew has bleached Newcastle of creativity and that under Mike Ashley's stewardship they have not invested in the past two transfer windows – began bubbling over. It could have been worse for Pardew, much worse. Fraizer Campbell's pace, particularly on the counterattack, frequently troubled a defence flattered by the clean sheet. As early as the sixth minute the former Sunderland striker accelerated into the area and, unmarked, connected with Fabio's right wing cross only to direct his volley wide. If that miss must have made painful viewing for a one-time striker of Solskjaer's calibre, the Cardiff manager's woes swiftly intensified. When Moussa Sissoko's long legs swept him up the right wing they initiated a move that concluded with Shola Ameobi heading his fine cross home at the far post. A minute or so earlier Mathieu Debuchy had thumped a header against Cardiff's bar following Vurnon Anita's corner but Solskjaer's side were regularly bisecting Newcastle's backline. Indeed, as Wilfried Zaha sashayed beyond Debuchy and company, Pardew must have braced himself for an equaliser – only for Tim Krul to brilliantly divert the winger's ensuing shot for a corner. It was time for Solskjaer to re-introduce St James' Park to a once extremely familiar face. On came Craig Bellamy and, prompted by some classy touches from a forward Sir Bobby Robson once delighted in bringing to Newcastle, Cardiff unleashed waves upon wave of surging attacks. Unimpressed, the crowd oscillated between loyalty and barely suppressed insurgency; between singing "Blaydon Races", "We want Pardew out" and "Hatem Ben Arfa." Excluded from Newcastle's squad, Ben Arfa, the team's most naturally gifted individual and a player increasingly seen as a scapegoat, sat in the stands. All around him small pockets of supporters began vanishing once the electronic clock signalled the hour mark had been reached. More followed on 69 minutes in recognition of Newcastle last winning a major trophy – the Fairs Cup in 1969 – leaving clusters of empty seats. With disputes breaking out between those staying and going the atmosphere was hostile and, unusually, bereft of humour. From Pardew's viewpoint it could have been appreciably uglier but, sensibly, he remained in his dugout throughout the second half, refraining from entering the technical area lest his appearance provoke mass anger. Peering out from beneath the safety of its Perspex roof he watched Krul save superbly from Kenwyne Jones and Fabricio Coloccini perform wonders to clear Aron Gunnarsson's shot off the line. Solskjaer's players did not deserve to fall further behind when Loïc Rémy's shot evaded David Marshall after Cheick Tioté's original cross-shot had been deflected and St James' knew it. Well aware he had nothing to celebrate, Pardew stayed put and the applause proved unusually muted. Shortly afterwards normal service was very briefly resumed when, with Cardiff overcommitted to attack, a customary roar greeted Newcastle's third goal, a header from the popular, Geordie-reared substitute Steven Taylor. At the final whistle Newcastle's manager shook hands with Solskjaer and disappeared straight down the tunnel. Visibly shaken, he did not join his players and staff for an end of season "lap of appreciation". Perhaps significantly a smiling Ben Arfa did.

Hatem Ben Arfa trained with Newcastle United's reserves once again on Thursday and could well have played his last first-team game at St James' Park. The France international, the club's most gifted and creative individual, gave an interview to selected national newspapers, including the Guardian, this week expressing his puzzlement at being banished from Alan Pardew's senior squad. Newcastle's manager, who did not sanction the interview and is expected to discipline Ben Arfa, remained unmoved. "They are his comments," he said. "But I will pick the team on merit." After six straight defeats and with many fans demanding his sacking, Pardew desperately needs a victory at home to Cardiff City on Saturday but Newcastle's manager is determined to win over the hearts and minds he has lost during the team's dramatic New Year slump. "I won't walk away," said Pardew whose side remain ninth thanks to a strong first half of the season. "I love this job and I'm going too fight as long as I can for it. "It's the toughest period of my managerial career but, yes, I do think I can survive it. As a manager you're going to have some bad times, some really bad times. If you're going to walk away, then in my view you do not have the make-up to be a manager or a leader of men. If you're in the middle of a field, surrounded by armies, left right and centre, you can't just say: 'I've had enough now, sorry.'" Particularly when you contemplate forfeiting one of the principal postings available in English football. "I consider this to be one of the biggest jobs in the country and to get the opportunity to be the manager of Newcastle is not something I'm going to give up lightly," he said. "I will fight for it with all I can. My love for the job gives me the strength to come through this. "The pleasure of winning at this football club matches nothing I've ever experienced before. But if you're going to get those ultimate highs, you're going to get the ultimate lows. I hope the fans stay with me on Saturday, I really do."

Once again there was the sight of a manager running along the touchline at Stamford Bridge, screaming to the skies and letting out all the euphoria. Except this time José Mourinho was back in the dugout, hands pushed into his pockets, absorbing the fact there will be no place for his team at Estadio da Luz in Lisbon on 24 May. Chelsea chose a bad night to lose their streak of resilience and Atlético were ruthless in the way they responded to Fernando Torres, their old favourite, opening the scoring. Chelsea have played with so much defensive expertise lately, but ultimately it finished as the heaviest defeat Mourinho has suffered on this ground. These were the moments when Atlético demonstrated why they are so close to breaking up the dominance of Barcelona and Real Madrid in La Liga. Adrián's equaliser changed the complexion of the game just before half-time and Atlético excelled in the second half. Diego Costa's penalty put Spain's champions-in-waiting in command and when Arda Turan followed in his own header to make it 3-1, Diego Simeone could be seen on his victory run. Simeone's team had shown great powers of recovery but Mourinho will be aggrieved by the way Chelsea abandoned the qualities that have made them such obdurate opponents. It leaves him staring at the strong possibility that his first season back at the club will end without a trophy. There is clearly work to be done because, amid all the analysis of his tactics, it is worth remembering he has opted for caution only because he knows the opposition are often more refined. Atlético confirmed that by running away with the game after the interval. Forty years since their last final, the team from Estadio Vicente Calderon might not have the gravitas of Barcelona or Real Madrid but two more wins in La Liga will confirm them as the best side in Spain. They did not always show it over the two legs, but their reaction to going behind showed, in Mourinho's words, that they are "solid, very mature, a real team". Simeone put it another way: "I would like to congratulate the mothers of these players because they have big cojones." Costa reminded everyone why Mourinho likes the idea of bringing him to Stamford Bridge next season, and Thibaut Courtois, on loan from Chelsea, confirmed he will be a worthy successor to Petr Cech. This cannot have been an easy evening for Courtois, given all the blurring of lines, but he made some splendid saves at key moments of the game. Chelsea had started the match with César Azpilicueta on the right of midfield and David Luiz operating just in front of defence. Their tactics, with six recognised defenders on the pitch at the same time, were predominantly based around stifling the opposition. Yet they did not neglect the fact they needed to get behind the opposition defence and their goal was classy in its creation. Branislav Ivanovic started the move on the right but it was Willian's improvisational brilliance that really created the danger. His turn, close to the corner flag, took him away from two defenders. Azpilicueta took possession and picked out Torres for a low right-footed shot that beat Courtois after a slight deflection off Mario Suárez. Torres celebrated the goal like a form of apology, with his palms spread as if asking for forgiveness from his former club. Yet he took the chance with the kind of clinical finish that was a throwback to his good old days in Atlético's colours, and Chelsea are usually so accomplished at defending the lead that it was unusual to see the carelessness that followed. Ashley Cole will wince when he sees the replays of the equaliser because he made a fatal mistake in assuming John Terry was going to clear Juanfran's cutback. Terry could not adjust his feet quickly enough. Cole had switched off for a split-second and Adrián's shot was driven into the ground, bouncing off the turf to loop in. Mourinho's first response to the equaliser came after 53 minutes when he removed Cole to bring on Eto'o. This was the signal that Chelsea would now have to start playing with greater adventure. The problem was two-fold. First, it meant leaving more space at the back for their opponents to exploit. Secondly, Chelsea's players continued to contribute to the team's downfall. Eto'o had been on the pitch only six minutes when he and Costa went for the same ball from an Atlético corner. The challenge was clumsy in the extreme and it was a straightforward decision for the Italian referee, Nicola Rizzoli, to make. Costa was shown a yellow card because of the amount of time he took with the penalty, but he eventually put the ball past Mark Schwarzer as though immune to nerves. A minute earlier, Courtois had kept out Terry's header with a save that Mourinho described as "impossible". Shortly after Costa's penalty, David Luiz's header came back off the post and Courtois pawed the ball away. Yet Atlético could also reflect on hitting the woodwork through Koke, the game's outstanding player, early in the match and when they did it again, after 71 minutes, Turan's header came back to him off the crossbar and he confirmed an all-Madrid final from the rebound.

A beleaguered Alan Pardew admitted his players had underperformed since the turn of the year and let down the club's support as the Newcastle United manager was subjected to angry calls for his dismissal from the travelling fans. Banners were unfurled among the 2,000 away supporters calling for Pardew to be sacked, with Newcastle fans chanting "It's six in a row" after the hour mark as the club sank to a sixth successive loss. The manager has overseen 14 defeats in 19 matches in all competitions since Arsenal won at St James' Park in late December, with his return to the touchline after a seven-game ban for head-butting Hull City's David Meyler having no discernible effect on his players. Pardew, who had chosen to omit Hatem Ben Arfa from the travelling party despite the player being fit, had been subjected to abuse in the recent defeat at Stoke and, when asked about the latest round of disaffection in the stands, said: "They're frustrated. We had 2,000 here tonight making this long, long trip. Although we're playing a good team, they still expect us to win. "They've seen us lose again and they're not happy, and I have to respect that. But all I can do is do this job to the best of my ability. We've been top 10 all year. We should have performed better in this run, I know, and we've got to finish in the top 10. If Cardiff think it's important for them on Saturday, it's important for us to finish in the top 10, too, believe me. "All I can do is get my team in the best possible place. We could have copped harm tonight when we were 2-0 but we came out with our dignity still there. We have to take that into Saturday. Our stadium have to give us the atmosphere on Saturday. We've got the best fans in the world, and they don't deserve the run we've given them, but we'll need their support. [The abuse] puts pressure on the team and myself. I have to do my best to protect the team and the performance." A sixth successive defeat represented Newcastle's worst run in the top flight since January 1987, with the side having scored only 10 goals in 2014, the fewest of any Premier League side. "But if we win on Saturday it'll guarantee us top 10, I'm pretty sure of that," added Pardew. "From there we can reflect, and we know we have to be stronger than we've been in the second half of the season. "Perhaps we excelled to a degree or exceeded ourselves over the first half of the season, and gave good value for money for this club in that half. Since Christmas we haven't. At 2-0 it was difficult for us tonight. We showed tremendous character second half. It's a difficult scenario, five defeats in a row and being 2-0 down at this place. At least we showed that second half." Arsenal can secure their top-four finish if Manchester City overcome Everton at Goodison Park on Saturday or by beating West Bromwich Albion on Sunday, though England's Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will not feature for the club again this season. Wilshere is back in training after a foot injury, while Oxlade-Chamberlain is resting a groin problem, with both players' fitness of interest to the England coaching staff. "Jack is training already," said Arsène Wenger, Arsenal's manager. "When will he be ready? Honestly I cannot tell you exactly. Next week or the week after … at the moment the progress he's making is good. I hope he can play at Norwich [on the final afternoon]. Alex has an inflammation of his groin. He couldn't practise. We played him when he was needed but it came to a point where it wasn't progressing so we decided to give him a complete rest for two weeks. Will he be involved with me? I think he has a chance. But will he be ready for England? I think so."

The first of Arsenal's redefined season's objectives is almost achieved. Victory here against an accommodating Newcastle United established a four-point cushion from fifth-placed Everton and, by the time his team host West Bromwich Albion on Sunday, Arsène Wenger may already be guaranteed a crack at a 17th successive season of Champions League football with the FA Cup final still to come. This campaign could yet feel productive. The mathematics of the run-in dictate that, should Manchester City defeat Everton, then the Londoners are confirmed in the top four with a familiar qualifier ahead. Yet, where Arsenal sauntered to victory, Alan Pardew was left squirming at his own side's latest inadequate performance. A sixth consecutive loss provoked calls for his sacking from the disgruntled away support, with banners unfurled and chants bellowed into the night sky. They are now in open revolt but there was much to encourage Cardiff and Liverpool, the teams Newcastle still have to play, in this feeble display. This had always seemed like Arsenal's opportunity to restore some breathing space from those who would oust them from the top four, a timely collision with a team whose form has evaporated since the turn of the year. Newcastle have been safe for too long but, where that would normally merit credit, it has actually affected focus. Their form had deteriorated to the tune of 13 losses in 18 matches in all competitions since the end of December before their arrival in north London. Injuries have taken their toll but Alan Pardew's absence from the touchline after a seven-game ban for head-butting Hull's David Meyler, in a match they had actually won at a canter, had hardly helped: three points from the possible 21 said it all. The manager had admitted his frustration at his own indiscipline before kick-off. "We are a team and it is important to have that connection on the sidelines," he had offered, the "connection" in question less with his forehead and more with his team. "I am looking forward to it [being back on the touchline]." Not that his demeanour suggested as much. He was back prowling his technical area from the outset here, clearly incapable of keeping that pledge, first offered up in the aftermath at the KC Stadium, to sit down, even while the contest was goalless and meandering. He has cut an agitated figure of late and was hardly reassured even by his team's relatively solid opening. This team can implode at any moment. Their resistance almost stretched to the half-hour mark but, by the interval, the contest appeared concluded with Tim Krul overworked if generally excellent. Arsenal had just started to fret at their inability to prise the visitors apart when Moussa Sissoko pulled back Olivier Giroud to concede a free-kick. Santi Cazorla's delivery was beautifully arced, bypassing those in the six-yard box, and was poked in by a sliding Laurent Koscielny, darting in behind Sissoko and ahead of the goalkeeper. The goal punctured what resolve the visitors might have mustered after thwarting Arsenal's initial forays. They rather limped to the interval, utterly reliant upon Krul to stave off a thrashing. Twice Lukas Podolski might have added a second, first fed cleverly by Aaron Ramsey to outpace Vurnon Anita and see his shot deflected behind by Krul, then as he planted a header goalwards from Cazorla's corner which the Dutchman did well to push away. Mikel Arteta was able to clip Giroud clear just before the break for the Frenchman, played onside by his compatriot Mathieu Debuchy, to collect and bear down on goal. His first effort was blocked by Krul, his follow-up again suffocated by the goalkeeper only to fizz across to Mesut Özil, free at the far post and played onside by a sliding Paul Dummett. The German's finish was dispatched almost disdainfully through Debuchy, who had retreated to the goal-line. Özil's interplay with Cazorla had been menacing, the pair clearly benefiting from the eager work-rate and delivery of Ramsey who has swiftly restored the rhythm to his play that had so driven this side's approach over the first half of the season. How this team must curse the Welshman's prolonged absence through injury from the festive period to the spring. His tracking back caught the eye as much as his forward-thinking here, with the team so much more assured in his presence. They pinned Newcastle back for long periods, the visitors only finding brief respite on the counter-attack courtesy of long-range attempts from Sissoko and Debuchy before Loic Rémy slipped Yoan Gouffran clear of Koscielny. The angle was unkind, his effort spat at the near-post where Wojciech Szczesny saved. By then the 2,000 travelling fans were making their disgust plain with furious chants of "it's six in a row", the tally of successive defeats too much for them to take. That dissent first rang out with half an hour of the game remaining, an indication of the extent of the erosion of faith in this team's powers of recovery. They had morphed into calls for the manager's head long before the end, their calls only choked when Giroud nodded home a third emphatically from Özil's centre.

Pep Guardiola and Carlo Ancelotti had never previously met as opposing coaches but we had witnessed this type of tactical battle many times before – it was simply possession play versus counterattack. Ancelotti generally preaches ball retention rather than counterattack but, against this Bayern Munich side, Real Madrid were always likely to spend long periods without possession. Besides, they had shown their quality in this respect with a superb counterattacking performance in last week's Copa del Rey victory over Barcelona. It was no coincidence Ancelotti replicated that starting XI as closely as possible, with the returning Cristiano Ronaldo replacing the hero in the final, Gareth Bale, who was fit enough only for the bench. This meant Real were essentially playing a 4-4-2 system, a formation widely considered inappropriate for possession football but perfectly serviceable when playing on the break. Real sat back, remained compact to prevent gaps appearing between their lines and waited for Bayern's passing moves to die. And die they did, with Bayern showing an alarming lack of penetration throughout the contest. While Guardiola's most surprising decision was continuing with Philipp Lahm in midfield rather than using him at right-back against Ronaldo, the Portuguese forward did not appear 100% fit and rarely made Bayern suffer. A more pertinent choice was the use of Bastian Schweinsteiger at the top of Bayern's midfield triangle, instead of in his customary deep midfield role. This was presumably because Guardiola wanted him to press Xabi Alonso and Luka Modric, Real's deep-lying playmaking duo, and prevent them from turning defence into attack smoothly. But this failed, and Schweinsteiger's deployment close to the striker Mario Mandzukic greatly stifled Bayern's attacking play. Schweinsteiger was unaccustomed to receiving forward passes in such tight spaces and did not vary his position to drag Real Madrid out of shape. Toni Kroos is far superior in the No10 position, albeit a role he has not consistently played since last season, and it felt as if Bayern were playing two star players in each other's position. Only in the final 20 minutes, when the substitute Thomas Müller played just behind Mandzukic and got himself into goalscoring positions, did Bayern genuinely threaten. Real, it must be stressed, defended marvellously. The centre-backs, Pepe and Sergio Ramos, were imperious in the air, while Daniel Carvajal and Fábio Coentrão tucked in narrow yet also darted out to confront Franck Ribéry and Arjen Robben when the ball was switched wide. More importantly, however, this was a genuine team effort – the entire Real side dropped back into their own half and formed a formidable wall Bayern were unable to penetrate. Other sides are criticised for playing so deep – across the city, Chelsea had done something similar the previous evening to record a goalless draw at Atlético. But Real were playing this system with more creative midfielders and more attack-minded wide players, and could have triumphed by more, as Guardiola admitted. Even Ronaldo played deeper than usual, while the striker Karim Benzema's work rate was best summarised by the fact he won possession deep inside his own half and then sprinted forward 70 yards into the opposition box to score the only goal with a simple tap-in. The home side's outstanding player, however, was Modric, thriving in precisely the sort of game Real recruited him for. Two seasons ago, Bayern outplayed Real at this stage partly thanks to a star performance from Kroos, who combined intelligent passing with mobility and the ability to evade challenges. At the time, Real lacked that type of player – Alonso was not mobile enough, Sami Khedira not technical enough, and Mesut Özil's contributions too intermittent. But Modric has solved that issue. There was one perfect example of his role, shortly after Real had gone ahead, where he effortlessly skipped around Schweinsteiger's challenge before playing in Benzema on the left, who crossed for Ronaldo to blaze over. This was not an obvious evening to marvel at passing statistics considering Bayern's futile possession play but it is precisely the fact Real recorded only 28% of possession that makes Modric's 97% pass completion rate so impressive. Anyone can complete passes when their side are dominating but Modric's ability to find team-mates so consistently, when under pressure, proves he belongs at this level.

This has taken on the appearance of an awkward hurdle in Manchester City's pursuit of the Premier League title. Their hosts have won five top-flight games in succession for the first time in 22 years, their safety assured and the manager, Tony Pulis, now urging his team on to a top-half finish. City, without David Silva and Jesús Navas, will be grateful for Yaya Touré's potential return in midfield as they seek to prolong the title race. Come kick-off, when the result at Anfield will be known, they will be better placed to judge their own challenge. Ship points in south London and it will feel forlorn regardless.

Real Madrid Iker Casillas 7 A year ago Borussia Dortmund and Robert Lewandowski were putting four past Diego López. Sanity, and the captain, are back now Daniel Carvajal 7 Faced with the twin threat of Alaba and Ribéry down his flank, the Real right-back would have expected a far harder night Sergio Ramos 7 When he is not getting sent off he reminds everyone of his quality as a fine defender and organiser. Will need to do so again in Munich Pepe 7 The elusive talents of Thomas Müller may have troubled him more than Mandzukic, whom he dominated before limping off Fábio Coentrão 7 With a strict brief to stick to Robben like glue he diligently did so and even found time to get forward well and set up the goal Luka Modric 7 Had clearly been given some extra defensive duties by Ancelotti. He struggled to hold off Bayern's central trio early on but improved Xabi Alonso 8 The former Liverpool man is so pivotal to this Real side as the shield in front of the back four, and he was not found wanting Isco 6 Came into the side and was asked to double up on Robben. Worked hard but was booked and substituted for the last 10 minutes Ángel di María 6 Argentinian will regret the moment he missed a golden chance to make it 2-0 before half-time and could not fill Bale's boots on Real's right Karim Benzema 6 Had barely touched the ball before giving his side the lead and he didn't do much after, but was in the right place at the right time Cristiano Ronaldo 7 Declared fit after a week-long pantomime, supplied key ball for Benzema's goal but guilty of a glaring miss before going off early Bayern Munich Manuel Neuer 6 Was such a strong doubt with a calf injury that Guardiola selected two keepers on the bench. He came through but had no chance with the goal Rafinha 5 Exposed for the goal and again for Ronaldo's awful miss, Guardiola may regret starting him ahead of Lahm at right-back Dante 6 The big Brazilian does not always look dependable and was partially culpable for the goal. Often too far away from Benzema Jérôme Boateng 6 Seemed to be close enough to Coentrão to cut out the cross for the goal but failed to get there and his side paid the price David Alaba 6 Austrian left-back loves to get forward but did not have his usual impact here as his link-up play with Ribéry came up short Bastian Schweinsteiger 6 Returned from his Rooney-induced suspension and was as combative as ever but lacked the dynamism to really hurt Real Phillipp Lahm 6 Guardiola likes to rotate his captain between right-back and midfield but he didn't have enough impact in the centre Arjen Robben 7 Dutchman saw plenty of the ball on return to the Bernabéu but, hard though he tried, could not find an opening for that vital away goal Toni Kroos 6 Arrived in the box with his trademark runs early in the game which promised more, but could not get past the excellent Alonso Franck Ribéry 5 Would have expected to prosper up against Carvajal but made very little impression before making way for Götze on 72 minutes Mario Mandzukic 6 The Croat is something of a strange fit for this star-studded Bayern side.

There is no point dressing it up as something it was not. At this level it is rare to see such a lack of vibrant football, or so many occasions when passes are misplaced and two sides play with so little penetration. The setting was wonderful, in one of Madrid's great venues, with the Almudena cathedral as the impressive backdrop. The din was as good as it gets in Spain. It is just a shame the two sides produced such a stodgy game for the size of the occasion. Chelsea, however, will not be too concerned if this match is added to the long list of games that is used to knock José Mourinho's ploys of conservatism and, ultimately, it is proven to be a valuable result. Nobody should be greatly surprised by their spoiling tactics and there is something to be said, once again, for their competitive courage in the face of a number of difficulties. Petr Cech's dislocated shoulder was a considerable setback and another followed in the second half when John Terry damaged an ankle. Yet Chelsea never wilted. Mark Schwarzer coped ably as Cech's replacement and the tie is poised nicely for the return leg, even if Chelsea's list of absentees probably means Atlético should still be regarded as marginally the favourites. Chelsea are certainly short of personnel given that Frank Lampard and Mikel John Obi both picked up yellow cards to mean they will be suspended. Gabi, the Atlético midfielder, will also be banned because of a yellow card but it is clearly not ideal for Mourinho that he now has to rely on Schwarzer for the remainder of the season. At 41 years and 128 days, the former Middlesbrough and Fulham goalkeeper became the oldest player to figure in the Champions League, taking Edwin van der Sar's record. The number-crunchers can also provide statistics that, in the history of the European Cup, show that the away side goes through after a 0-0 draw in the first leg in 67% of matches. What is clear is that it will need another performance of defensive expertise if Chelsea are to buck that trend. The Vicente Calderón stadium might not have the same gravitas as the Bernabéu or Camp Nou, but the acoustics are better and Diego Simeone's team, sitting defiantly at the top of La Liga, had the backing of a passionate and partisan crowd. It was a kaleidoscope of colour, with huge banners tumbling down from the vertiginous stands, and the acclaim that Fernando Torres received on his homecoming made way for raw spite when the Frente Atlético turned their attentions to Mourinho. Yet Chelsea have silenced opposition crowds in Barcelona, Munich and Istanbul in the past few years, and their system, flooding midfield and breaking only sporadically on the counter-attack, had turned down the volume here, too, by the end. The style of play was designed to smother, with Torres often cutting an isolated figure, but Chelsea have great qualities of structure and organisation and they are entitled to play to their strengths, even if in doing so they made it a prosaic and disjointed match. On nights like these they are not an entertaining team but, in mitigation, they were also missing Eden Hazard while Torres would not have played had Samuel Eto'o been fit. They might not satisfy the purists but these are the tactics, roughly speaking, that have Chelsea trying to reach their third European final in successive seasons. Cech was hurt as he jumped to turn a corner over his crossbar and David Luiz's push sent Raúl Garcia clattering into the goalkeeper while he was in mid-air. The fall was thudding and spectacular and Cech quickly signalled that he was unable to continue, needing extensive treatment before being led off with a blanket around the shoulder. Atlético must have been encouraged by the sight of Schwarzer in the opposition goal, but his handling was immaculate and there was no sign of nerves in the biggest match of his club career. Chelsea's defence also did a fine job of keeping out Spain's top team. Ashley Cole did not look like a man who has been marginalised so abruptly this season. A considerable bit of Terry's thou-shall-not-pass mentality has rubbed off on Gary Cahill, and César Azpilicueta rose to the occasion. His block, as Diego Costa was shaping to shoot, was typical of the way Chelsea set about the opening half. What they did not possess was a cutting edge. They failed to manage a shot on target until Lampard's effort early in the second half, and Atlético's fans could be forgiven for wondering when, or where, Torres lost his sureness of touch. Willian and Ramires had the energy and pace to join him occasionally, but this is not a front three to terrorise opponents at this rarified level. Torres put a shot straight into the arms of Thibaut Courtois but Chelsea did little otherwise to see if their on-loan goalkeeper might have been affected by the fuss surrounding his involvement. For their part Atlético, despite vastly superior possession statistics, did not pass the ball penetratingly enough to put Schwarzer in any real danger.

Sylvain Distin ensured there would be no repeat of the controversy surrounding Samir Nasri being left out of the France World Cup squad when he announced his tongue-in-cheek retirement from international football. Given that he is 36 years old it could be viewed as the defender taking a sensible approach to prolonging his club career with Everton. On the other hand, it may seem slightly premature considering that he has never actually been capped by France, a thought that was probably uppermost in the mind of Didier Deschamps when he announced his World Cup squad on Monday. Distin tweeted: "I'm retiring from France team. It was a wonderful experience and after a record of #0 cap it's time to say goodbye and focus on my club." When Nasri was left out of the squad on Monday, his girlfriend Anara Atanes, hit back on Twitter with: "Fuck france and fuck deschamps! What a shit manager!" At least the French coach will be spared the wrath of Mrs Distin.

Arsène Wenger admitted his 1,000th game as Arsenal manager had turned into "a nightmare" after a remarkable 6-0 trouncing at Stamford Bridge that will be remembered for José Mourinho's biggest ever win for Chelsea and the extraordinary moment when the referee, Andre Marriner, sent off Kieran Gibbs in a case of mistaken identity involving Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Arsenal have never lost by a heavier score to Chelsea and Wenger was so aggrieved he did not appear at the post-match press conference. "I don't believe it is the time to talk too much about [what went wrong]," he explained. "It was a nightmare and I take full responsibility for it. The players are deeply disappointed, as we all are. When you don't turn up in a game of this stature – nobody takes that easily." Chelsea rushed into a two-goal lead inside the first seven minutes, through Samuel Eto'o and André Schürrle, and went further ahead before half-time via Eden Hazard's penalty and Oscar. Two more goals in the second half, from Oscar and the substitute Mohamed Salah, left Arsenal's aggregate score in their away games at Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool this season as 17-4. "It was 10 amazing minutes," Mourinho said of Chelsea's start. "In 10 minutes you can win a game. In 10 minutes you can show anybody you won't give any chance to any opponent. I am so happy with the approach. We came to kill and, in 10 minutes, we destroy. After that, easy." The Chelsea manager added: "My analysis is all about those first 10 minutes. To play against 10 men is easier, obviously, because you are more comfortable and relaxed but the way we started there was no doubt. After 10 minutes, this game is over." The game's controversy arrived after a quarter of an hour when Oxlade-Chamberlain's handball gave Hazard the chance to make it 3-0 from the penalty spot. Marriner was alerted to it by one of his linesmen and showed the red card to Gibbs despite Oxlade-Chamberlain owning up to the offence. "The referee made a mistake because he missed the identity of the player," Wenger said. "He has not seen what happened at all. He gave a corner. I don't know who told him that it was a penalty. Maybe it was a penalty. But it was not Gibbs." Marriner admitted later it was a mistake via a statement from the Premier League referees' body: "Andre is an experienced referee and is obviously disappointed that an error of mistaken identity was made in this case. Incidents of mistaken identity are very rare and are often the result of a number of different technical factors. ''Whilst this was a difficult decision Andre is disappointed that he failed to identify the correct player. He expressed his disappointment to Arsenal when he was made aware of the issue.'' Arsenal have grounds to appeal and Mourinho said it was time for fourth officials to be given access to television monitors. "The sending-off is big ammunition for people like me who think that one little screen in front of the fourth official is a big help against this kind of mistake. "The important thing is the penalty was a penalty and there was a red card, even if they didn't know who. After that, it would be nice for the referee to have technology and for the players, too. It was Chamberlain, not Gibbs. It is the kind of mistake no referee wants to make." Wenger had to face chants of "specialist in failure" from Chelsea's crowd as his team were left seven points off the top, albeit with a game in hand. "It leaves us in a very bad situation," he said. "But we want to respond. "We had two difficult away games at Tottenham and Chelsea. If we had played two draws we would have two points. Having won one, we have three points. But today is a huge disappointment, of course. "What is important is to give a response [against Swansea] on Tuesday night and that is it. We have to win the next game. That is what we have to focus on now and give a strong response."

The Liverpool bandwagon rolls on. "We're gonna win the league" reverberated from the travelling supporters after a sixth successive Premier League victory maintained Liverpool's pursuit of a first title since 1990 and offered further evidence of their staggering firepower and ability to score almost at will. Trailing 2-1 at one stage, Liverpool responded in emphatic fashion through a hat-trick from the irrepressible Luis Suárez, who took his tally for the season to 28 in 25 appearances, two goals from Martin Skrtel and another for Daniel Sturridge. Cardiff, who remain second bottom, were powerless to stop the inevitable Liverpool onslaught. Brendan Rodgers's side have racked up 24 goals across those last six league fixtures, an incredible return that underlines why they are not just legitimate title contenders but also entitled to stake a claim to be the most enjoyable team to watch in the Premier League at the moment. Sunderland travel to Anfield on Wednesday night and it would be easy to forgive Gus Poyet and his players for arriving with a sense of trepidation. It is the first of five home games Liverpool have in their remaining eight fixtures – another reason for supporters to believe this could be their year. "The immediate future is all I can focus on," Rodgers said. "The fans can believe and dream – and that's important when you're a supporter. And when you come and see your team play away from home and score six goals, then you've got every right to do that." If there is one nagging doubt about Liverpool's ability to finish top come 11 May, it is the defensive vulnerability that surfaced again here. Cardiff, who have struggled for goals all season – Suárez alone has plundered more than Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's entire squad – managed to score three times and on each occasion Liverpool's defending left much to be desired. Conceding three and beating Cardiff, Stoke and Swansea is one thing; doing the same against Manchester City or Chelsea is quite another. It was put to Rodgers that there are similarities between Liverpool and the Newcastle team that Kevin Keegan managed the first time around, when the modus operandi seemed to be to simply try to outscore opponents no matter what happened at the other end. "I think we're a totally different team to that – they were a wonderful team," Rodgers said. "It's not how we work. We don't look to just outscore opponents, we work on our balance, we just conceded poor goals [today]. "We're off the back off two clean sheets, which I take as much pride in. We just conceded too much space. But the key thing for me is how we respond, and how we've grown over the last 18 months has been that mental resilience and that confidence to know that we can get back into game, so I'm more pleased with that." For Solskjaer, the biggest frustration was the manner in which Liverpool went ahead for the first time. When Skrtel headed in Philippe Coutinho's corner to put Liverpool 3-2 in front, Mutch and Kévin Théophile-Catherine were both off the pitch, after being ordered to leave the field following treatment. "I think you should look at that rule," the Cardiff manager said. "How can you defend a corner kick with nine men, and two of your men have not faked anything, they've not dived, they just want to get [back] on the pitch. I said to the fourth official: 'They're going to score here.'" Solskjaer was at least able to take some encouragement from the way Cardiff played in the first half. Mutch put them ahead in the ninth minute, after Campbell capitalised on Joe Allen's wayward pass, and although Liverpool equalised through Suárez, following a fine move involving Glen Johnson and Jordan Henderson, Cardiff were soon back in front. Daniel Agger was left badly exposed by Mutch's slide-rule pass and Campbell skipped past the Dane before confidently beating Simon Mignolet. Skrtel then grabbed his first to bring Liverpool level, when he got in front of Juan Cala to volley in Coutinho's cross, and the central defender added his second of the afternoon with a glancing header when Cardiff were down to nine men. Sturridge's delightful backheel set up Suárez for the Uruguayan's second and the roles were reversed for Liverpool's fifth. Suárez, running on to Johnson's long diagonal pass, got away from Steven Caulker before crossing for Sturridge to tap home. Mutch's 88th-minute header, from a Kenwyne Jones knockdown, after the Liverpool defence again went missing, gave the scoreline a more respectable look from Cardiff's point of view but Suárez was not finished. Shrugging off Cala, the striker sprinted clear in injury-time and beat David Marshall with nonchalant ease to register his third hat-trick of an extraordinary season. "He's a remarkable player," Rodgers said.

José Mourinho claimed Chelsea were back "among the best eight clubs in the world" after last season's Europa League winners eased beyond Galatasaray to ensure there will be at least one English team participating in a Champions League quarter-final this season. The Portuguese said he hopes his side will be joined on Wednesday by Manchester United, who are seeking to overturn a 2-0 deficit from the first leg against Olympiakos, but praised his players for outclassing their Turkish opposition to force passage into the next round. Mourinho has never lost a quarter-final tie in the Champions League and will await Friday's draw for the last eight in Nyon with relish after beating Galatasaray 2-0 on the night and 3-1 on aggregate. "We are there [in the last eight] but it's different from last season because, then, that was the Europa League and at a different level," he said. "To come from the Europa League to the quarter-finals of the Champions League is important for the club, important for the players. We are a Champions League club and now we are among the best eight, the best clubs in the world, and we are there. The players deserve to be there. "All the big teams are there. All the big candidates to win the competition are there. And we would welcome any one of them. It would be very good for our evolution as a team and very important for us to play one of the best. We wait for the draw. It doesn't matter who. They are all welcome." The manager suggested he had been unaware of his own record in the last eight of Europe's elite competition. "Why should other teams fear [Chelsea]? I've never lost in a quarter-final? I've never thought about it." Mourinho, who had watched from afar as the London club failed to make it out of the group stage in the Champions League despite being holders last season, is expected to be charged with misconduct by the Football Association on Wednesday and fined around £10,000 after being sent to the stands for encroaching on the pitch in Saturday's defeat at Aston Villa. It was the second time this season that he has been dismissed from his technical area after a misdemeanour in October's victory over Cardiff, an offence which prompted a standard £8,000 fine. Tuesday night's occasion was considerably more comfortable than the match at Villa Park, with Didier Drogba – granted a rapturous reception before kick-off and a fine send-off at the end on his first appearance at Stamford Bridge since leaving Chelsea in 2012 – becalmed by the excellent John Terry and Gary Cahill. The veteran was presented with a silver boot to mark his eight-year spell at Chelsea but was granted only one glimpse of goal, and that came in second-half stoppage time. "The most difficult thing was the way his team played," said Mourinho. "When you are a striker, if your team doesn't produce attacking football, you feel like a lonely man. It happens to every striker in the world: if the team is not there to play behind you, you are a lone[ly] man. So I think he couldn't do much. I have to say, in my opinion, Gary and John made a fantastic performance against two very good strikers in Burat [Yilmaz] and Didier. But the fact is we controlled the game so well that you could never see Didier in dangerous positions." The Galatasaray manager, Roberto Mancini, was disgusted with his side's display. "We prepared this game and started at 1-1," the Italian said. "I was confident we'd do a good game, have chances to score, but it was really important to start the game without conceding a goal. Instead we conceded after four minutes [to Samuel Eto'o]. During the game our more experienced players did nothing. For this reason it's difficult for me. We didn't have any players who 'played' this game. We can't play like we did in this performance [and expect to do well]. If we want to play at this level, we need to work more and do more steps [forward]." The former Manchester City manager's parting shot was to tip his former club to pip Chelsea for the Premier League title. "I think that Manchester City are the best team," he said. "They are the best team. They have the best players. I think that Manchester City have a big chance to win the Premier League, probably against Chelsea. I don't know if Liverpool, who are doing very well at this moment, can win it. I think it will be a fight until the end with Chelsea." Chelsea renew their challenge by hosting Arsenal on Saturday lunchtime in Arsène Wenger's 1,000 match in charge of their London rivals. Mourinho confirmed the home side would not be making a pre-match presentation to the visiting manager to mark the occasion. "No, because the best present is to have 1,000 matches in the same club," he said. "If Chelsea gives me the chance to arrive to 1,000 matches, I'd be the happiest man there is in the world."

On Tuesday, Uli Hoeness cheered his club from the stands as they progressed to the next round in the Champions League against Arsenal. on Thursday, the former Germany international and president of Bayern Munich sat in silence as a judge sentenced him to three and a half years in jail for tax fraud calculated to have cost the state more than €28.5m. Hoeness, who won the World Cup with West Germany in 1974, last year admitted to squirrelling large profits made on the stock market into a Swiss bank account, opting for what German law calls "voluntary disclosure", where evaders can avoid trial by detailing taxes they have skipped and paying them back with 6% interest.But during this week's trial in Munich, it not only emerged that the sums Hoeness evaded were almost 10 times higher than previously assumed, but also that he failed to disclose his accounts within the rules. Prosecutor Achim von Engel described the case as a "particularly grave case of tax evasion", calling for five and a half years in prison. The defence sought a suspended sentence and now has a week to appeal against the verdict. Even before the sentencing, the most high-profile tax evasion trial in German history has already had a noticeable effect: more than 26,000 German tax evaders have opted for voluntary disclosure since the Hoeness revelations hit the headlines in 2013. In Bavaria alone, the figure has quadrupled since 2012. Reactions varied from fans' laments to those decrying the sentence for leniency. The country's largest-selling tabloid, Bild, welcomed the verdict: "Bitter for Hoeness, good for tax justice", ran the headline. On Twitter, Daniel Mack, a Green politician, called the sentence "the longest sending-off in Bundesliga history". Hoeness's defence lawyer, Hanns Feigen, had repeatedly drawn attention to the social causes to which the Bayern president had committed himself. Strong-willed and often disliked by other teams' fans, Hoeness also had a reputation for running Germany's most successful club with the genial atmosphere of a family business. He arranged for his former strike partner Gerd Müller to be given a job at the club when the retired star was suffering from alcoholism, and organised support for another player, the talented midfielder Sebastian Deisler, who was blighted by bouts of depression. Repeatedly lauded for his charity work, Hoeness told Bild said in 2005: "I know it's stupid, but I pay all my taxes." The details that have emerged over the last 15 months paint a different picture. Between 2001 and 2010, he made more than 50,000 stockmarket transactions. A self-confessed luddite when it came to using computers, Hoeness conducted most of his deals via a hand-held pager, often during matches or boardroom meetings. Among Bayern colleagues, the gadget was jokingly known as Hoeness's "Tamagochi". Asked in an interview with Die Zeit if he was addicted to gambling, Hoeness said: "I don't consider myself ill, if that's what you mean ... Maybe I was close to it for a couple of years. But nowadays I consider myself cured." His son Florian, 34, had interjected to point out that "the family begs to differ a little on this point". With Barcelona having recently been charged for tax fraud over the signing of Brazilian star Neymar, two of Europe's most successful clubs are now under pressure to repair their reputation. Bayern say they won't comment on the sentence until after the appeal, though a statement on the future of the club's presidency from the supervisory board – which contains high-profile executives from Adidas, German Telekom, Volkswagen and Audi – is expected on Friday. On Saturday, Bayern will play Bayer Leverkusen in the German league. If Hoeness attends, it is likely to be the last match he will watch in person for some time.

Ultimately, when the story comes to be told of this open and fast-changing title race, Manchester City might look back and reflect this was a particularly useful result. Yet, for now, they also know it could have been considerably better bearing in mind the rewards if they had held on to David Silva's first-half goal. Manuel Pellegrini's team were unusually lacklustre as victory slipped away. Perhaps there were signs of weariness, too, after the exertions of the Manchester derby. All that can be said for certain is the chance to replace Chelsea at the top of the league was missed and Mathieu Flamini's equaliser threatens repercussions now Liverpool are looking at the table in a new position of strength. For Arsenal, it was a gallant second-half performance but the draw probably confirms what most people already suspected, namely that there is only a faint chance the team in fourth can overhaul those above them. City are in a much stronger position, two points behind Chelsea with two games in hand, but the gap to Liverpool will be four if Brendan Rodgers's team beat Spurs on Sunday today. More than ever, it looks like the pivotal game will be City's trip to Anfield on 13 April. Pellegrini could still declare it a productive period, with four points from two challenging away games, and will have to hope his team can play more like they did here in the first half, and less like after the interval. David Silva controlled the game in the opening 45 minutes, with Chelsea's defeat earlier in the day sharpening their minds. They exposed Arsenal on the counter-attack, just as José Mourinho's team had done the previous weekend, and started pretty much from where they finished off against Manchester United. Yet Arsenal deserve acclaim for their perseverance and left the pitch at the final whistle to rich applause. Arsène Wenger has had to make do with a considerable injury list, missing half a team's worth of first-choice players but his side showed real personality and that is worth noting when they are often accused of lacking mental strength. "We have gone through a nightmare," Wenger said, with the 6-0 defeat at Chelsea still in his mind. "You could see against Swansea the team was on the floor and hugely disappointed. But we responded well today." In the opening 45 minutes, Wenger's men had struggled for any real fluency in attacking positions. Yet Santi Cazorla was a prominent figure in the revival, aided and abetted by the ubiquitous Flamini and Tomas Rosicky, and gradually the tide changed. Silva, so dangerous in the first half, faded. Jesús Navas had menaced Arsenal's defence early on but was eventually substituted and Pablo Zabaleta's overlapping runs, another early feature, were gradually curtailed. Yaya Touré has not had such an undistinguished game for a long time and Edin Dzeko was another who struggled to replicate the same level of performance that was seen against United. Arsenal had a touch of good fortune because Rosicky could easily have been sent off on two different occasions. His early attempt to win a penalty, dangling a foot to try to initiate contact with Zabaleta, did not deceive Mike Dean and warranted a yellow card. Rosicky was booked for a challenge on Gael Clichy and scythed through Silva later in the match. Silva was also shown leniency for a challenge on Mikel Arteta at the end of the first half but the yellow card was probably correct and, out of the two, Rosicky was the more fortunate. City went ahead after 19 minutes with a goal that provided further evidence of Arsenal's vulnerabilities. Lukas Podolski lost the ball and, in a flash, the entire home team suddenly looked susceptible to the speed with which their opponents poured forward. It was the same theme against Chelsea and, again, there were defenders – in this case, Kieran Gibbs and Bacary Sagna – hopelessly out of position. Silva led the charge and Dzeko was running into the left-hand side of the penalty area, with the opportunity to find an angle past Wojciech Szczesny. His shot came back off the upright and Silva, following in, was rewarded for his anticipation, tucking the rebound into an exposed net. The complexion of the game changed eight minutes into the second half. Shortly before, Sczcesny's parry from Navas's right-wing delivery came back off Per Mertesacker and was perilously close to being an own-goal. Arsenal, however, were moving the ball with greater purpose now. Podolski crossed from the left and Flamini was in space, close to the penalty spot, to take advantage of some obliging marking. From that point onwards, the volume went up. Podolski, with a clear sight at goal, would have turned it even higher if his shot had not flicked off Hart's legs and ricocheted wide. There were still sporadic moments when City threatened to get behind the home defence but they had lost their control and left the pitch knowing it was a more profitable result for Liverpool than anyone else.

The mud-spattered Mercedes van is parked up pitch-side, its back doors flung open and all the training paraphernalia pouring out on to the grass. Cones, metal-framed dummies, energy drinks, bibs and strapping fall to the turf. The surrounding area is littered with flip-flops and trainers, some snazzy, others scuffed and worn, with the entire squad having laced up their boots al fresco on the touchline. This could be park football on a Sunday morning. It is actually a professional team reborn. The setting is Langstone student village, mid-morning on a Friday, and on the university campus's main pitch the players of Portsmouth Football Club are preparing for a critical game against Hartlepool. Pompey, FA Cup winners in 2008, a side who confronted Milan in the Uefa Cup the following season and seven years a Premier League club, are five points above the condemned at the foot of League Two, with their third manager of term, Andy Awford, barking orders. "Be physical. Get in their faces. Be horrible. Squeeze the line. Rash him, as tight as you can." It is Awford's second spell in caretaker charge this season and, backed up by Alan McLoughlin, Paul Hardyman and Martin Hinshelwood, his tenure will extend to the summer at the very least. The players are revived in his company. This is the modern-day Portsmouth, the top-flight club brought to their knees by financial mismanagement now transformed into a setup proudly owned by their supporters and whose ability to thrive as a Football League member may yet define the perception of community-run clubs. Their story requires some context, though there is no need to linger over what brought them to their lowest ebb before the fans provided salvation. The decline is well-documented. There were two long periods in administration: the first after the Russian-Israeli owner, Sacha Gaydamak, cut off the funding in 2009; the second, in 2012, followed the arrest for alleged bank fraud in Lithuania of a subsequent owner, Vladimir Antonov, who left £35m debts, plus £17m owing to another former owner, the Hong Kong moneylender Balram Chainrai. Mention of the names will for ever provoke shudders of apprehension down the spines of those associated with this club. There were three relegations in four seasons, the squad stripped bare even if it was liquidation that was the truly sickening fear, before the city bit back. The Pompey Supporters' Trust and their partners, 11 local businessmen "presidents", mounted their bid and, on 10 April last year, Chainrai finally agreed to release his charge over the stadium, Fratton Park, and settle for a price of £3m. Saturday marks the first anniversary of the takeover's completion, the trust having raised £2.3m with the presidents investing £1.7m. This is the country' biggest community-owned club, backed by 10,600 season-ticket holders, 3,500 trust members, and a vociferous support. They are a club with a chance to heal and grow organically. A once-bankrupt institution is fast becoming a financial success story, no longer reliant upon sugar-daddy funding – with the coffers in their healthiest state for 40 years. Ticket sales, corporate hospitality and renewed commercial activities, allied to cost savings, have led them to outperform their original budgeted forecasts. This club committed to pay in excess of £8m still owed to 21 former players by July 2016, though those debts are being cleared quicker than expected. "For the first two years we were going to have to pay more to players who don't play for us than the ones that do," says Ashley Brown, chairman of the Pompey Supporters' Trust and one of the body's three members elected to the board. "Welcome to the crazy world of football. "We had a loan of £1.45m from the city council, which we paid off in two months, and a loan of £1.2m from our property-development partner, Stuart Robinson, which we agreed to pay off within a year and that's on schedule. We're ahead of schedule on the football creditor debts. The final parachute payment, which runs out this summer, has helped us to do that, but what has been achieved has been quite amazing considering where we started: no players; no management structure; no kit sponsor; no shop; we had to rip up all the hospitality and bring it in-house. The transformation has been astonishing." It had felt almost like starting from scratch but the talk now is of £1m in summer developments at Fratton Park – new drainage, a relaid playing surface, better facilities for disabled supporters – and an £800,000 investment in a new training ground at Roko, Hilsea, which will mean the days spent changing on the sidelines at Langstone will soon be over. "We've been in discussions for five or six months, some quite sensitive because, as a community club, we clearly can't displace another community club," says Mark Catlin, their Barking-born chief executive who arrived via Bury. "But everything's been verbally agreed, we're at the solicitors stage now. Having that base for the team and the academy will give us some of the stability the football side of the business has needed." The hope is the diggers will move in next month, with the facility – designated changing rooms, initially two pitches and a Championship-quality gym area – to be ready by September. The club's high‑net‑worth fans are funding a large proportion of the development, with other monies to be raised through schemes over the weeks ahead. "This has been an eye-opener for all of us, but we are committed to making it work," adds Catlin. "The real pressure is the fact all these people have scrimped and scraped and put their hard-earned cash into the club to keep it going, and that is one hell of a responsibility to take on." The city has been galvanised by the reclaiming of its club, the Pompey brand no longer toxic and, instead, restored as a source of local pride. Those overseeing Pompey in the Community, the charity arm of the club, are best placed to confirm as much. "There's a different feeling now," says Clare Martin, the body's chief executive. "People feel as if they belong to something. We were delivering at a lot of schools, even during the two administrations, but we're now picking up new schools all the time. Pompey is the city as well as the club, and people want to be associated with Portsmouth again." The 46 projects run by the community scheme touch about 37,000 individuals, aged from three and 93, the Pompey brand engaging all-comers, whether it be on educational projects, health and inclusion initiatives or football coaching courses. The club's study centre is a constant hubbub of activity, the projects benefiting from player appearances or free tickets, and all offered under the Pompey umbrella. "Our 'extra time' project for the over-60s was supposed to run for five weeks but two of the old boys burst into tears when we said it was the last session so we extended it to 13 weeks," says Martin. "We've also run a 10-week 'back to work' programme and, at the end of the course, 62% of the participants found full-time employment. Whenever one of them got a job, we all felt as if we got the job." In a city where a study conducted last year by the Campaign to End Child Poverty suggested 27% of children are living in poverty, such initiatives are invaluable. "Portsmouth has some of the most deprived areas in the country, it's a tough city, so a lot of the work is centred on literacy, numeracy, core skills the kids don't necessarily get otherwise," says Brown. "We talk about being a community club but if this branch of the organisation didn't exist, we wouldn't deliver anywhere near as much as we ought to. "People had become disassociated with the club, there was disillusion, so the last year has had a cleansing effect. A lot has been achieved. But, to be honest, there has been so much concern recently about the league form we haven't had a chance to look back at the last year with any great sense of pride. We've been focused solely on the league table. When we have enough points and everyone breathes a sigh of relief, we'll have a quick reflection on what we've done and think about how we can do things better. We're not having this again." Full-time is approaching against Hartlepool and the strain is starting to show. Awford, suited and booted, is pacing his technical area, cursing his team's slackness in possession and bellowing instructions to anyone who will listen. Above him in the south stand the chairman, Iain McInnes, feels as if he has been kicking every ball, thumping the front of the directors' box in frustration and forever leaping to his feet to join in with the clapped encouragement emanating from the Fratton end. Noel Blake and Vince Hilaire, former players of pedigree, are fidgeting due to the tension. Catlin, further down the front row, has been consumed with nerves since well before kick-off, his jitters hardly eased pre‑match when news filtered through that the Tannoy announcer had broken down at traffic lights on the A27 at Farlington en route to the game. A few frantic phone-calls to a local pick-up firm later and he was delivered. "That's a community club in action," offers one trust member. Pompey score in the second minute, miss a penalty in the fifth, and endure six minutes more of added time with their lead still fragile. "This is just the way we do things," McInnes says once the whistle has shrilled. "Nothing's ever simple when it comes to Pompey." Where progress has been marked off the pitch over the past year, it has continued to be traumatic on it, a campaign best summed up in numbers: four contracted players at the start of last summer; two permanent managers since; two assistants, four goalkeeping coaches and two physios; 46 players used; 51 points accrued. Guy Whittingham, the manager who began the season, was a club stalwart and his exit in November was painful. Richie Barker came highly regarded, along with Steve Coppell – employed in an advisory role and only claiming expenses – but lasted only 109 days. Barker's tenure encompassed 20 games, four wins and 11 goals, with the team failing to score in six home fixtures. In the context of four years of blood-letting, that the framework was weak was perhaps inevitable. "I always imagined our biggest challenge would be off the pitch, but it's been on it where we've been really tested," Catlin says. "Every time we thought we were up and running we've been kicked in the teeth again." League Two is unforgiving. The bookmakers had installed Portsmouth as pre-season favourites for promotion, hoodwinked by the optimism generated by the takeover. The immediate target is very much survival. "It goes back well beyond the summer," says Awford, whose association with the club stretches to 25 years as player, coach, head of academy and now caretaker manager. "Two administrations in three years scarred us, and the rebuild is a bigger job than people thought. It will heal, but it can't be a quick fix because there was so much wrong. Even I lost track of who actually owned the club at one point. Crazy times … The FA Cup, Milan, I wouldn't give it up for the world, but ultimately it was to the detriment of the club." Images from that most superficially glittering period in Portsmouth's recent history, of Peter Crouch and Sol Campbell, or Kanu and Jermain Defoe, wearing blue and white, still adorn the corridors at Fratton Park. Yet once they were demoted from the elite, all semblance of stability on the pitch evaporated. The Austrian midfielder Johnny Ertl, once of Crystal Palace and Sheffield United, feels like a veteran of this squad. He initially signed in the autumn of 2012 on a succession of short-term deals – "nine or 10 of them" – before finally earning a three-year contract last summer. "I've trained with 80-odd players in my two years here, and we must have signed 15 last summer alone, players we had to try and integrate at four different training venues at the start of the season. The club is like a big tree which blossomed in the Premier League, giving night fruits with the FA Cup, and then they chopped it down. But the fruits were rotten. Now, as a League Two club, we need to lay down new roots so we can grow again. "We don't have the resources of the past. We are a community club, we don't have a chairman who will pump money in and buy instant success, but everyone is trying his best to rebuild, laying the foundations with the academy, the training centre. That's why I stayed here. I love the people, the club, the fan base. But we knew it would start in a difficult way." Ertl has just completed a masters in business administration, affiliated to Wels University back home and supported by the Professional Footballers' Association, examining the financial situation in British football. He envisages a future as a director of football. He may be needed. The 31-year-old was cast aside by Barker but returned to the lineup, as captain, in the victory against Newport in Awford's first game back. His steel and commitment helped curtail a six-game winless run. Against Hartlepool the caretaker manager restored Simon Ferry after a 14-game absence, his young side bustling with vitality from the outset. Jack Whatmough, an England Under-18s defender who has just signed a three-year contract, excelled at centre-half to the coos of the 11 scouts sitting in the south stand, while Nicky Shorey, an England left-back under Steve McClaren, scuttled up the flank. A crowd of 15,273 bellowed their encouragement and defiance – "We own our own club", "We will never die" – as McInnes went through his agonies in the directors' box and Hartlepool mustered a flurry of stoppage-time corners. The relief was palpable at the final whistle, even if the visitors' threat had been fitful. It was the first time in more than a year that Pompey had secured successive league wins. The result left them five points clear of the cut-off, their timely surge of momentum maintained at Dagenham &amp; Redbridge last Saturday, when a side with faint play-off aspirations were dismantled and defeated 4-1. Northampton's own flurry of recent results has seen the gap from the bottom two shrink to four points, though other clubs have been leapfrogged and the contests with Bristol Rovers on Saturday and at Sixfields against the Cobblers on Monday will surely prove decisive. A fourth relegation in five years is unthinkable but, while it would be a huge blow to the community club's pride, it would not threaten them as a going concern. That, in itself, speaks volumes. "But we won't go down," Awford adds. "Although there's a long-term target to put the club back into the Championship, that process would be set back unless we sort out the here and now, and that's what we'll do. I'm all about longevity, but my immediate task is short-term. Four games, two weeks, stay up." Then the rebuild kicks on.

1) The grey clouds are clearing for Arsenal Arsenal have won just two of their past eight matches but they will arrive for this one in upbeat form. Not only will the sight of Hull City remind them that they will soon contest an FA Cup final and perhaps end their epic trophy-drought, but Everton's surprising defeat to Crystal Palace has given Arsenal a boost in the chase for the final Champions League spot meaning that, like last season and contrary to the stereotype, Arsenal could take advantage of another team's bottling. Hull, meanwhile, still need a victory to confirm their Premier League survival and Steve Bruce will likely give Shane Long and Nikica Jelavic the chance to shoot past Wojciech Szczesny – none of that trio are likely to feature in the final so all talk of a dress rehearsal for Wembley is to be treated with the contempt that all cliches deserve, at the end of the day. • Wenger: Özil can be Player of the Year next season • Szczesny's dream may spell agony for friend Fabianski • Huddlestone: It would be nice if Arsenal won nothing again 2) Has Mourinho grown weary of his own hypocrisy? José Mourinho dodged another press conference this week, adding fuel to suspicions that he is storing up all his bon mots for some masterful machiavellian outburst just before the do-or-die clash with Liverpool. Or maybe he's just grown weary of his own cant. What is for sure is that the best way for Mourinho to put pressure on Liverpool this weekend is by getting his team to beat Sunderland to regain top spot the day before Brendan Rodgers' side play Norwich. With a Champions League semi-final to follow later in the week, Chelsea are unlikely to deploy Eden Hazard even if he is fit but Mourinho has to make sure that, unlike at Aston Villa and Crystal Palace recently, his team are still prepared to focus and fight enough to secure the three points. Gus Poyet, meanwhile, has to coax another performance from his side like the one they produced at Manchester City. That seems improbable. • Poyet: we are playing for ourselves not Liverpool • Inter confirm interest in Torres and Dzeko 3) Pulis at Palace is the great entertainer Crystal Palace go to Upton Park on Saturday three points above West Ham United, which is a pretty amazing turn-up. Sam Allardyce and Tony Pulis are often depicted as two managers from the same sack but the latter is deservedly the more acclaimed at the moment. It is not simply because expectations at Palace were lower – the Selhurst Park din-makers would never boo their team off after a victory – it is also because Pulis's side really are more entertaining to watch than West Ham. Even though they have scored fewer goals this season – a paltry 27 in 34 games – Palace have attacked with a flair often missing from West Ham. Yannick Bolasie, Jason Puncheon and even Cameron Jerome and Marouane Chamakh have made thrilling contributions that prove Pulis has done more than just make Palace solid and hard to break down. Another eye-catching win here would surely deepen the discontent at West Ham. • Pulis took Palace role after long talk with Sir Alex • Tomkins trial delayed after police lose CCTV footage 4) Is Lambert victim or cause of Villa's ugly mess? Aston Villa are the lowest-placed club yet to change their manager this season and the owner, Randy Lerner, claimed this week that he had no plans to jettison Paul Lambert any time soon. That was a rare show of support for a manager who goes into this weekend's game against Southampton on the back of four straight defeats, the loss of his best player, Christian Benteke, to injury and new sidekicks following the suspension of his seemingly estranged former allies, Ian Culverhouse and Gary Karsa. Lambert will hope that his new broom helps clears what seems an ugly mess, otherwise the supporters calling for him to be swept away too will continue believing that he is part of the problem. • Lambert lieutenants suspended to clear 'poisonous atmosphere' • Lambert stands firm as takeover rumours mount • Shaw staying put at Southampton says manager Pochettino • Big interview: Calum Chambers 5) Was Tan right all along? Victory at Southampton last week spawned an unfashionable thought: what if Vincent Tan was right? What if Ole Gunnar Solskjaer really is the man to lead Cardiff to Premier League safety? Suddenly it looks possible: Cardiff are three points behind Norwich, who face a hellish run-in while the Welsh side's next three games are against Stoke, Sunderland and a bunch of crash test dummies in Newcastle jerseys. That's a pretty accessible-looking escape route. What's more, some of Solskjaer's January signings are starting to look shrewd. Wilfried Zaha has thrived in his new role just behind the striker, Cala defended stoutly and scored the shock winning goal at St Mary's last week and, most of all, Mats Moller Daehli has in recent weeks displayed the nimble ingenuity that has led many Norwegians to hail him as the most exciting prospect ever to emerge from their country, including Espen Baardsen. Mark Hughes is in for a tough assignment on his return to Wales. • Premier League to look into Cardiff's team-leak claim • Ireland signs three-year contract extension at Stoke 6) Will Sturridge injury benefit Suárez? Win at Carrow Road and it will be mission accomplished for Liverpool: they will have secured qualification for the Champions League, which is the assignment Brendan Rodgers was given at the start of the campaign. But surely they will not settle for that now: this has become the best chance they have had to win the title for 24 years and, given how strong the competition will be next year and the extra demands that European competition will bring, it could be the best one they have for the next 24. If they fear blowing it, they have channelled that fear superbly so far. Yet each week brings not just a sterner test of their steel but also of their squad: Jordan Henderson will miss the trip to Norwich (and the following two matches with suspension) and Daniel Sturridge looks unlikely to be risked. Joe Allen could do a decent impersonation of Henderson but it will be interesting to see how Rodgers replaces Sturridge. Will the manager just slot someone else in up front or will he alter his formation, abandoning the diamond that has served him so well in the past couple of months and shifting Philippe Coutinho and Raheem Sterling alongside Luis Suárez in a 4-3-3? Whatever Rodgers decides, it could be that Sturridge's absence is not so ruinous. It gives the England forward time to recover fully for the Chelsea match and it will also afford him a chance to refocus. Sturridge has excelled this season but in recent weeks has been out of form, lapsing back into the wonky decision-making ways that made him so frustrating at Chelsea. Even Suárez has appeared exasperated by him at times. Then again, Suárez has looked exasperated by lots of people in recent weeks, possibly because he is frustrated with himself: for his performances have also dropped below the stellar standards he has set and he even looked tired as well as irritable against Manchester City last Sunday. A slight change to the team around him and the sight of a Norwich jersey may just reinvigorate Suárez, who seems to take particular pleasure in tormenting the Canaries. Failure to extend their winning run to 11 matches would not be fatal to Liverpool's title challenge but it would complicate their task – they will probably go for a win against Chelsea no matter what happens, but it would suit them better if José Mourinho did not come to Anfield knowing that a 0-0 would suffice. • Rodgers warns Liverpool to learn from Manchester City dip • James Dutton: Can Liverpool cope without Henderson? • Anfield redevelopment moves a step closer 7) Moyes should give Rooney the rest of the season off This season David Moyes has heard more grim stats than a slob surrounded by weighing scales and he returns to Goodison Park hoping to avoid becoming the Manchester United manager responsible for allowing Everton to record their first league double over United in 44 years. Of course, Moyes can take hope from one of the few positive stats to United's season – they have the best away record in the league. Apparently he is also taking hope from the fact that Wayne Rooney resumed training on Thursday for the first time since his damning appearance against Bayern Munich. That is ominous. Moyes's era at United risks being defined by his curious indulgence of Rooney, which seems motivated not so much by a conviction that Rooney represents the best possible future of the club but rather by an eagerness to disprove the suggestions made before the new manager's arrival that he would not be able to get along with the biggest-name players, especially one with whom the Scot had unhappy history. If it seemed misguided to award Rooney a new five-year contract earlier in the season, it looked utterly ludicrous to play him against Bayern Munich when he was palpably unfit. If Moyes insists that Rooney really is the way forward, it may not be a bad idea to give the player the rest of the season off to nurse his foot before heading to the World Cup. That would give Juan Mata, Shinji Kagawa and Adnan Januzaj the chance to prove that United are not as dependent on Rooney as the manager seems to want to believe. • Rooney to return from injury against Everton • Manchester United fine Cleverley, Welbeck and Young • Everton extend Howard's contract by two years • Martínez refuses to concede fourth spot to Arsenal 8) Is Pellegrini's position under threat? Poor Manuel Pellegrini. In the space of a few days he has gone from fighting for the title to fighting to convince some fans that he deserves to keep his job. Questions are being asked about the Chilean after the way Manchester City's title challenge seems to have unravelled. City have suffered from recurring problems all season: defensive blunders and intermittent losses of concentration and, with the exception of the splendid Fernandinho, none of the club's expensive summer signings have been surefire successes. But it is also true that the flair that Pellegrini has introduced would probably have offset some of those failings if Sergio Agüero had not been injured for so long and if, just as the Argentinian finally returned to action, Yaya Touré and David Silva had not been struck down. Are those excuses credible enough for Pellegrini to be given another season to fine-tune his team? A strong finish to the campaign may help settle the debate in his favour. Another display like the one against Sunderland, especially against the almost equally hapless West Bromwich Albion, would do further damage to the manager's standing. • Pellegrini says City can still win Premier League • Manchester City are world's highest paid sports team • Anelka's move to Atlético Mineiro off 9) Can Rodallega make up for Holtby's absence? When Hugo Rodallega almost broke down in tears at being hauled off in the 59th minute of February's home defeat to Sheffield United in the FA Cup, it was impossible to imagine that he would re-emerge as the solution to Fulham's striking problems. Unsurprisingly, René Meulensteen and then Felix Magath exhausted every other option before turning in desperation back to the Colombian, who had not scored a Premier League goals in well over a year. And then, very surprisingly, Rodallega spearheaded Fulham's late charge towards survival, scoring the winning goals in the victories against Aston Villa and Norwich. Doing the same again on Saturday would be his most impressive feat yet, as Tottenham Hotspur are a better side than Villa or Norwich and Lewis Holtby cannot play against his parent club. The on-loan German has been Fulham's most creative player during their recent revival and they will miss him badly. Time for another unexpected hero to step to the fore. • Duff to seek move abroad in bid to escape 'rat race' • Bale's Real Madrid winner bittersweet for Sherwood's Spurs 10) Will Rémy or Bony halt the slides? Swansea started the season as Britain's model club but they're finishing it in the sort of state with which Newcastle are more usually associated. Garry Monk, who has yet to win an away match in his short managerial career, takes his team into this game on the back of reports of an almighty training ground donnybrook in which several senior players engaged in fisticuffs and, although Monk says those reports were exaggerated, you can be sure that team morale took another kick in the swingers. The mood is, of course, similarly gloomy at Newcastle, who have ambled to eight defeats in their past 11 matches, promoting calls for Alan Pardew and/or Mike Ashley and/or the entire senior squad to be run out of the Toon. Swansea are only three points above the relegation zone but Pardew needs a win just as badly. His cause could be boosted by the return of Loïc Rémy. With Wilfried Bony in line to start for Swansea, the outcome of this match may be determined by which of these two potent strikers gets the best service. • Swansea City confirm training-ground clashes • Pardew's fight for Newcastle future helped by Rémy return • Louise Taylor: Pardew playing dangerous blame game • This story was updated on 19 April to reflect the fact that Fulham's defeat to Sheffield United was in the FA Cup, not the Capital One Cup

It was a week for football's golden oldies. Samuel Eto'o, at 33, deftly opening the door against Galatasaray and Arsenal and Ryan Giggs, at 40, adding calm and class to Manchester United's engine room against Olympiakos. Arsène Wenger, at 64, chalked up his 1,000th Arsenal game in a daytime "nightmare" at Stamford Bridge. Amid the eulogies for Wenger, John Hartson spoke of his methods "putting another two or three years" on the careers of Tony Adams, Lee Dixon and Ian Wright. Few would dispute that. In the past decade, those methods have become football's methods. Players are fitter. They recover from training with finely tuned protein-carb shakes, ice baths and massage; not a swift one-two at the pub. We have come a long way from the days when footballers regarded broccoli as that guy who produced the Bond movies, and only did a downward dog when they slid off a bar stool. Last year Sir Alex Ferguson said that "sport science is the biggest and most important change in my lifetime". Manchester United monitor 29 variables that may increase a player's susceptibility to injury; sometimes players will be pulled out just before training because something in their data isn't right. Given such widespread advances, you might expect the average age of players in Europe's top leagues to be climbing sharply. It is not. The Football Observatory recently compared the average age by position of players in the Premier League, Serie A, La Liga, Bundesliga and Ligue 1 from 2005-06 to 2013-14 and found it was also static. The average age of a first-team defender in the big five European leagues in 2005-06 was 26.21 years; now it is 26.35 – an increase of 0.14 years. The figures for goalkeepers, midfielders and attackers have barely changed either. Meanwhile in the Premier League, Prozone's data for the 2011-12 and 2012-13 seasons shows that full-backs 33 or over played just 2.0% of all minutes played by full-backs. For wide midfielders that figure was 2.7%; strikers 3.6% and central midfielders 4.9%. For central defenders – whose positioning can sometimes negate a lack of pace – it was higher at 10.1%. So what is happening? Two things. Sports science is helping older players to stave off the effects of ageing. But, at the same time, the physical demands on footballers is far greater too. So the status quo prevails. Once footballers hit their early thirties they are on borrowed time. Just like they always were. What is striking, though, is how much faster football has become in the past decade. TV commentators in the 1970s and 1980s were fond of talking about matches being played at 100-miles-an-hour. It was a Sunday morning pootle compared to today's game. In 2006-07 the average number of sprints per team in a Premier League match was 330.2. This season Prozone's data show that it is 431.1, a 30.6% increase. Meanwhile recovery time between high intensity sprints (speeds of greater than 5.5 metres per second) has dropped from 54.6 seconds to 43.5 seconds, a decline of 20%. Perhaps it is not surprising there are so few full-backs, wide midfielders and forwards over 33. They play in positions where a dip in pace is more likely to affect performance. It is not only in road safety adverts where speed kills. Another development is that clubs monitor GPS and heart-rate data in training. They usually know when a player is 'gone' before we do. The growth in post- and pre-season tours may also be a factor. Players have less down time to recover in the off-season – so recovery time, which becomes more important with age, can be scarce. Of course the rate of decline will vary. Genetics, lifestyle, injury history and the number of games can all be a factor. But players are battling against age earlier than is often assumed. Maximal aerobic capacity – or V02 max – peaks around 18 to 20 and while it can plateau until 25 it tends to then decrease by approximately 8-10% per decade. Dr James Carter, the head of the Gatorade Sport Science Institute at Loughborough University, says that vigorous training after the age of 25 can limit that decline to around 5% per decade but "significant reductions in physiological and performance-related capabilities will be more pronounced once a player enters their thirties". With some players physiology is not everything. Even in his final season, Paul Scholes's passing figures were as good as ever. Others make themselves relevant in fresh ways. When Giggs still possessed the acceleration of a Maserati and the hips of a ballroom dancer, the ball was lover to nuzzle on those jinking, parabola-like runs; now it is more of a passing acquaintance. But as a general rule, improvements in sport science and medicine have benefitted younger players as much as older ones. And so veterans are better retained at a similar rate than they were a decade ago. As Carter reminds us, "extending the shelf life of footballers beyond 35, in most cases, is still beyond the remit of science, technology and best practice". When Giggs and Eto'o started out, football was considered a young man's game. Despite their notable achievements in the past week it still generally is.

Saido Berahino once again used Twitter to rule out the possibility of a deadline day move away from The Hawthorns an hour before the transfer window closed. Referencing his social media outburst in September when he was denied a late move to Tottenham, Berahino wrote: “Everyone waiting once again for the silly little spoilt boy to make same mistake so here you go. Goodnight all and thanks for the support.” Earlier, the Baggies had rejected a £21m bid from Newcastle and stressed there was no chance of Berahino being allowed to move before the end of the transfer window. In September, Berahino revealed his frustration after the West Brom chairman, Jeremy Peace, rejected two deadline day bids for him from Tottenham. “Sad how i cant say exactly how the club has treated me but i can officially say i will never play Jeremy Peace,” Berahino wrote at the time.

The crowd are whistling. Something has happened. Marco Materazzi is on the ground. The match commentators are confused. They think David Trezeguet has had something to do with it but they are just guessing. Their eyes, and the eyes of hundreds of millions of people around the world, were on the other end of the pitch. They did not see it. Gianluigi Buffon did. He races to the officials on the sideline, remonstrates and points fingers. By now the rest of the players have cottoned on. On the sidelines, Marcello Lippi has to be restrained. In the midst of it all one man is calm. Zinedine Zidane just stares ahead. Having talked with his assistants, the referee, Horacio Elizondo, approaches the French captain. A red card is waved. Zidane, with an arm around his shoulder, tries to explain that he had been provoked. It is all to no avail. What many people forget is that Zidane was not supposed to be there in the first place. The shock exit at the hands of Greece in Portugal at Euro 2004 had signalled what he called “the end of a cycle” and had convinced him that he should retire from international football. It was no longer for him. On 12 August 2004 he released a statement on his website. “I have thought long and hard over this decision. I think that at a given moment you must say ‘stop’ … There have been some great players who retired in 2000 and 2002, other players are doing it and now I’m doing it.” Almost exactly a year later Zidane would use that very same website to announce his return. There had been rumours that he would do so but Zidane had publicly denied them. When asked by L’Equipe for his reaction to the news, Christophe Dugarry, a former World Cup-winning team-mate of Zidane’s, instructed the paper not to run the story as he thought somebody must have hacked the website. There had been no piracy involved, however, Zidane was back. “For the very first time in my life I have decided to go back on my word which is very important for me,” read his statement. “When I made the decision to retire I was very serious – today I have made the same decision but in reverse.” Zidane had listened to the voice. “One night, at 3am, I suddenly woke up and I then spoke with someone,” he said, explaining his reason for coming out of international retirement. “Until I die I will never tell [who that person was], this is just too crazy. This is someone that you will probably never meet. During the hours that followed I was on my own with that person, at home, and I took the decision to come back. I had never experienced that before, I felt pushed by this force which dictated my behaviour. It was a revelation for me, I had to obey that voice that was advising me.” The manager of France, Raymond Domenech, publicly declared himself to be “extremely happy” that Zidane – as well as Claude Makélélé and Lilian Thuram – had decided to come out of retirement and so he should have been. Domenech had done very little to persuade the three players, who had a combined age of 98, to stay on when he took over from Jacques Santini in 2004 but his France side were struggling through World Cup qualification and in need of experienced professionals. The manager looked out of his depth. Writing about France and Zidane’s return for the Observer a year before the tournament, Darren Tullett quoted one French World Cup winner as saying: “Domenech is a prat and we haven’t got a clue what he’s going on about half the time.” The results at that stage in the qualification process backed up the player’s claim. France may have been undefeated but there had been too many unconvincing displays in a weak enough group. That was especially true at home where they had racked up scoreless stalemates against Israel, Ireland and Switzerland (Cyprus and the Faroe Islands made up the rest of the group). That left Domenech’s side in fourth place, three points behind the group leaders, Ireland, with just four games to go. Their hopes of making Germany looked set to be dashed. However, with Makélélé, Thuram and Zidane restored to the squad France won three matches, drew the other, finished top of their group and the country could let out a sigh of relief. Three weeks before the end of La Liga’s 2005-06 season, it was time for another announcement from Zidane. This was it for him. He was done with club and international football for good. “I have to listen to my body and I cannot carry on for another year. I think it is better to clarify the situation now. I have been thinking about it for a long time. It’s been three years since we [Madrid] won anything and in two of those, I’ve not played as I’ve wanted. I am not going to play any better than I have done in the past. I don’t want to just play for Real Madrid for the sake of it.” There would be no more jaw-dropping volleys and there would be more balletic pirouettes, his signature move that left defenders rooted to the ground like an old tree. There would, however, be one last chance of glory on the biggest stage football has to offer. While Spain, Brazil and Portugal all qualified from the group stages with three wins, nine points and the utmost of ease, France recreated their poor form from qualification. Their first match was against Switzerland. Kobi Kuhn’s limited team knew the French only too well and they were able to frustrate their foes at every turn. From little material, Zidane, captaining the team, fashioned his side’s only real opportunities but both were spurned by team-mates. Fires burned, nostrils flared and tempers bubbled. Thuram and William Gallas felt the lash of their captain’s tongue. The match ended in a goalless draw. France’s next match failed to offer little improvement in terms of result or, indeed, performance. A Thierry Henry goal after nine minutes gave them the lead but South Korea took the game by the scruff of the neck and deserved their point in the 1-1 draw, if not all three. In the eyes of the French this was a humiliating result that was made worse by the form of Zidane. “The way the France captain played,” wrote Michael Walker in the Guardian, “he is in danger of being referred to as the once-great Zidane … this was not the Zidane we will recall or want to recall.” Playing as part of a trio behind Henry, he was “slow and sloppy”, a mere shadow of his former majesty. Domenech agreed. With three minutes of injury time left and France in search of a winning goal, he took off the three-time winner of the Fifa World Player of the Year award and replaced him with Trezeguet. Unless France beat Togo in their next match that would be the last time that the world would glimpse Zidane at work, a most ignominious exit for a glorious player. He had picked up two yellow cards and was suspended for the next game. Togo were poor, but it took 55 minutes for France to break them down. Patrick Vieira celebrated his 30th birthday with his fifth goal in 90 appearances before Henry got his second of the tournament to seal the victory. France could have won by more but they were held back by Trezeguet’s lack of confidence and Franck Ribéry’s errant finishing. Nonetheless, they were through to the next round, qualifying in second place just ahead of South Korea. They had won their first World Cup match since beating Brazil in the final eight years earlier and they had done it all without Zidane in their side. Such had been the midfielder’s wayward performances by that stage of the competition that ahead of the last-16 match against Spain, the Guardian ran a referendum questioning whether Zidane should start. “The powers of the once imperious midfielder looked to have deserted him … would Domenech be better to stick to a winning formula to generate much needed momentum?” it asked. Few who had seen him play would have argued that Zidane deserved to be anything other than a spectator but Domenech disagreed. Zidane would start. Eric Abidal backed his manager’s choice: “Zidane will be the difference,” he said. Abidal could never have known how prophetic his words would be but he surely knew how little say his manager had at that point of the tournament. “Domenech had come into the 2006 World Cup with a masterplan that quickly looked more like a botched strategy devised by someone who didn’t master much, least of all his own players,” wrote Philippe Auclair of L’Equipe in his biography of Thierry Henry, Lonely at the Top. “Frustrated by their incapacity to overcome modest opponents in the group phase, senior members of Domenech’s squad … decided to take the matter into their own hands and impose self-governance within the French camp. That, at least, is the way in which France’s resurgence from the round of 16 onwards is almost universally explained in my home country.” Zidane, of course, was the most senior of those senior members and he was about to take total control. With just seven minutes remaining on the clock and sides drawing 1-1, France won a free kick outside the box. Spain had been very impressive in the group stages and many expected them to finally come good in major tournament (their starting 11 contained eight players who would go on to win Euro 2008 and the 2010 World Cup, and afterwards Henry admitted that “people ... thought we were going to get killed against Spain”). By this stage in the game, the momentum had seemed to be swinging towards them – just minutes before Joaquín had rifled a shot wide of the post after making a mockery of the France defence. Then up stepped Zidane. His free kick was converted by the head of Vieira. Nine minutes later and two minutes into injury time, with Spain still in search of an equaliser, he picked the ball up wide on the left. Marauding into Spanish territory, he quickly cut inside Carlos Puyol and fired inside Iker Casillas’ near post. He was back and with a bang that could be heard from Paris to Pamplona. Next up was a date with tournament favourites Brazil. Fifty-six minutes into the game France were awarded a free kick wide on the left when Cafu fouled Florent Malouda. Zidane stood over the ball once again. He spotted that the Brazilian defence had gone to sleep at the back post and aimed for that area. Within moments Henry had put France into the lead and the striker was celebrating with his team-mates. Zidane, however, stood apart from the rest, smiling to himself. Just as with the match against Spain, it was he who separated the two sides. At one stage he held off Kaká while juggling the ball and later he would knock it over Ronaldo’s head, making the World Cup winner look like a lost schoolboy searching for his mother. “He ran the game,” wrote Amy Lawrence for The Observer. “From the first moment, when he signalled his intent by carving through the yellow shirts, to the last, when he pushed up front in search of the killer goal. And in between he delivered the most memorable touches, the sweetest moves.” Henry’s goal was enough to win the game for France. They were through to the semi-finals where they would face Portugal. Those who fail to learn from history are bound to repeat it and Portugal failed to learn. In Euro 2000 they gave away a penalty to lose 2-1 to France in the semi-finals and it happened again in Germany. Henry needed no invitation to hit the ground in the box but an experienced defender such as Ricardo Carvalho should really have known better than to be putting in such a challenge in such a situation. The Portuguese keeper, Ricardo, may have been able to halt England but he could not do the same to Zidane, whose two-step run up and crisp finish had too much power for him to keep out. Zidane’s goal was enough to win the game for France and set up a final with Italy. The statue that commemorates that moment stands around 16 feet tall, almost three times as high as the two men its story centres on. And yet it could have been all so different. Zidane had given France the lead in the final in the most audacious fashion. There cannot be too many players who would have the confidence and audacity to successfully execute a Panenka in a World Cup final but Zidane did. Deep in extra-time he almost doubled his goal count for the game. Just outside the Italian area, he played the ball to Willy Sagnol out on the right-hand side, before moving through the opposition defence with all the silence and stealth of a spy on a secret mission. Sagnol’s cross was met with a powerful header from his captain that forced Buffon to tip the ball over the bar with a most magnificent save. The various videos and angles of the build-up to the headbutt show Materazzi’s mouth moving but his words can only be heard by one person, the one person who matters, the one person Materazzi wants to hear. Despite the scurrilous and evidence-free accusations printed by some newspapers, the defender’s words were not about his opponent’s religion or ethnicity. “I prefer the whore that is your sister,” Materazzi would later admit to saying. It was the sort of schoolboy insult that Zidane, and thousands of other professional footballers, must have heard from fans, and indeed fellow players, on a regular basis. Something, however, snapped that evening in Berlin and in Zidane. All the beauty and brilliance of his play in the knockout stages melted away and what was left was his anger and aggression. “I tried not to listen to him but he repeated them several times,” said Zidane. “Sometimes words are harder than blows. When he said it for the third time, I reacted.” Zidane had already taken some steps past the Italian defender when the red mist descended like a fog on Dickensian London. He lent forward, lowered his head and rutted like a deer in mating season. Afterwards, his opponent clutched the ground and his chest like a drunk their last bottle. Zidane’s stare communicates his sheer contempt for Materazzi and his words. “I would have rather been knocked down than hear that,” he said. Pandemonium then took hold on and off the pitch and within moments Zidane was gone. Perhaps the most iconic image of 2006 World Cup is not the dark-eyed Zidane standing over a stricken Materazzi but the picture of the solitary Zidane walking past the glistening World Cup trophy on his way back to the dressing room. So near and yet so far. After his goodbye speech in the dressing-room to his retiring captain was done, Domenech began the applause, but “there was only the grinding of teeth” the French manager said. “Certain players really hated their captain.” They were not the only ones who were dismayed and disappointed by Zidane’s actions. Le Figaro called his head-butt “odious” while L’Equipe’s front page asked: “What should we tell our children, for whom you have become an example for ever? ... How could that happen to a man like you?” Frank Leboeuf, meanwhile, described himself as “ashamed” by the actions of his former team-mate. Zidane could have been forgiven for feeling a sense of trepidation upon his return to France. He would have been aware of the reception that greeted his Real Madrid team-mate David Beckham after he arrived back in England in 1998 following his sending-off against Argentina. France, however, was different. There was no need for armed guards and there was burning of Zidane effigies. Instead, the Place de la Concorde was filled with thousands of fans waving flags and rhythmically chanting “Zizou! Zizou!” like monks in a monastery worshipping a higher power. Jacques Chirac, the president of France, led the tributes. “The match you played last night was full of talent and professionalism,” he said. “I know that you are sad and disappointed but what I want to tell you is that the whole country is extremely proud of you. You have honoured the country with your exceptional qualities and your fantastic fighting spirit, which was your strength in difficult times, but also in winning times.” Chirac’s words may have seemed to be a touch excessive but they reflected what the people wanted to hear. Polls done in the immediate wake of the incident backed up the public shows of support for Zidane: 61% of French people said they had already forgiven him for his actions while 52% said they understood them. His bones had ached, his form had dipped but Zidane managed to conjure up a final, extended piece of magic to woo the world. His performances after the group stages, according to Auclair, “ranked among his finest in a blue shirt”. Not many would argue against that. Before the tournament, few in France could have hoped that the team would come within a penalty shoot-out of winning but Zidane had given them hope. “For a month, France was dreaming with Zidane” wrote Libération but that dream was dashed the moment Materazzi opened his mouth and Zidane turned to face him. And yet the people of France would not let that moment of madness tarnish all that he had given them throughout his career. As one French writer said at the time: “It’s good for us to see our national hero is fallible.” What the Guardian wrote: Italy strike gold as Zidane sees red By Kevin McCarra, Berlin, 10 July 2006 Italy are world champions, with a flawless set of penalties in the shoot-out securing football’s ultimate prize. They had never been undisputed masters in any other aspect of the final, yet the honour is theirs for the fourth time in their history. The veterans of France, tapping unimaginable reserves of stamina, had been more potent from the opening of the second-half onwards but are now submerged in the miseries of their leader. A red card rather than a greetings card ushered Zinedine Zidane into retirement 19 minutes into extra-time. The captain was sent off for reacting to a dispute with Marco Materazzi by turning and butting the scorer of Italy’s goal in the chest. He had surely been provoked - there were suggestions last night that Materazzi had called him “a terrorist” - but Zidane will be right to curse his stupid reaction. This World Cup had come to mean too much to him and the dismissal followed three bookings in his six matches here. The 34-year-old was as overwrought as any testosterone-maddened youngster but could still have contrived a triumph. Five minutes before his expulsion he was unmarked to connect with Willy Sagnol’s cross 12 yards out but his header was tipped over by Gianluigi Buffon. Goalkeepers had little to do, even if the final was diverting and often classy. Buffon might as well have been a bystander in the shoot-out, since a Juventus team-mate David Trezeguet bashed his penalty against the bar. The left-back Fabio Grosso secured victory for Italy from the spot. One of the worst aspects of the sudden-death system is that it leaves the losers tormenting themselves over each detail that might have been different. Thierry Henry, affected for a while by a first-minute head knock, had a splendid, free-running spell after the interval and compelled Buffon to an important stop. The coach Raymond Domenech, though, was eventually to substitute him. By then Henry was exhausted but his removal meant that neither he nor Zidane could face Buffon in the shoot-out. The veteran, in a rather erratic fashion, had illustrated at the very start of the night that he could beat the goalkeeper. After six minutes Henry headed into the area from the left and Florent Malouda went down as Materazzi closed on him. There had seemed to be a slight contact, enough to meet the referee Horacio Elizondo’s criteria. Plotting the penalty, Zidane almost baffled himself in the battle of wits. He had scored the single goal of the semi-final against Portugal from the spot by hitting a sharp, low finish to the goalkeeper’s right. Here, confronted by his former Juventus colleague Buffon, he opted for the opposite. The ball was floated the other way, where it caught the underside of the crossbar and dropped over the line. There was a suspicion then that luck would rally to Zidane ‘s aid with the total fulfilment of his life as a footballer. Minds turned to the symmetry of his impact, considering that he had delivered an opener, too, when France took the 1998 World Cup in Paris. The harmonies of history were, in practice, to take another shape entirely. Italy had never before conquered on penalties in the World Cup finals and were even vanquished by France in that fashion at the quarter-final stage eight years ago. A nation famed for its icy efficiency was bound to put that right sooner or later. France had made Italy turn into a former incarnation of themselves. The manager Marcello Lippi has been encouraging a more expressive style but that had been of sporadic worth. Not even the loss of Patrick Vieira in the second half, to a hamstring injury, halted the rising assertiveness of Domenech’s players. Lippi would be driven to bolster his midfield with the introduction of Daniele de Rossi, who came fresh from a four-game ban for elbowing the United States forward Brian McBride in the face. The manager was reacting to circumstances then, but had evidently conducted a measured examination of the France back four beforehand. Materazzi equalised by overpowering Vieira to meet an Andrea Pirlo corner on 19 minutes and smash a header into the net. France’s discomfort at set pieces was never eased and, when Francesco Totti released Luca Toni for an effort that was blocked, Domenech’s team faced another corner. Pirlo flighted it once more and, on this occasion, it was Toni who won the header but hit the crossbar. The long-serving France players did understand how to regroup and not long after the interval the Italy right-back Gianluca Zambrotta ran a serious risk with his challenge on Malouda. The argument for a penalty was stronger than it had been at the opening of the evening, yet the ref eree was reluctant to grant a second for an offence on the same player. The changes of personnel made by a perturbed Lippi were nearly followed by a breakthrough. The dead-ball expert Pirlo piloted one more free-kick and Toni can have been off-side by only a fraction as he headed the ball past Barthez. There will be no regrets for any Italian in the return to supremacy of their national team, following the ignominy of early exits at the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004, but this was not exactly the culmination that had been anticipated. Lippi’s team, overall, has been the best in this tournament but recognition of that is muddled by admiration for the pluck that France showed and sadness that Zidane should have left the stage in such a dismal manner.

Liverpool will attempt to shore up their decidedly porous defence from the goal-line out, by replacing the occasionally flappy Simon Mignolet with Víctor Valdés, who long ago announced his intention to leave Barcelona this summer. A keen windsurfer, the goalkeeper could well have his head turned by the prospect of availing of the Liverpool Watersports Centre's modestly priced board hire rates with free safety cover. Preposterously handsome Italian footballer Claudio Marchisio has no interest in windsurfing, preferring instead to spray himself in perfume, read books about astrology and gad about in Dolce &amp; Gabbana pants. Despite these myriad shortcomings, the Juventus midfielder has also been linked with a move to Liverpool, while Arsenal and Manchester United are also believed to be sniffing around. Happy to admit to moisturising daily, Marchisio was rather more coy when asked about interest from England. "Sometimes I have received phone calls from agents who told me of the interest of clubs such as Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool," he said. "But no one from these clubs, however, has never contacted directly us. And in case I would tell them to talk to Juve." A host of doe-eyed suitors are believed to be forming an orderly queue outside the Etihad upon hearing that Edin Dzeko has apparently been informed is free to go to any club willing to pay £15m for a very large Bosnian striker who'll be expecting wages of £150,000 per week in exchange for sporadic bursts of goal-scoring activity. Dzeko has a little over a year left on a contract that City have no intention of renewing and the Champions League also-rans will mull over bids from Inter, Borussia Dortmund, Napoli, Arsenal and any of the many other European clubs believed to be interestested in bringing him on board. Certain newspapers who were falling over themselves to accuse Arsenal of making up the hamstring injury that sidelined Mesut Özil during Arsenal's defeat at the hands of Bayern Munich on Tuesday night are now reporting that the midfielder could be out for up to six weeks with his imaginary ailment. Despite the expert diagnoses of some of the press box's finest medical experts, it seems Arsenal decided to send their prize asset for a scan last night and are expected to reveal the full extent of his non-existent injury later today. With both Ben Watson and Chris McCann out for the rest of the season, Wigan Athletic are hoping to bring Jack Rodwell in on an emergency loan from Manchester City. Having failed dismally to make an impression at the Etihad since his £13m move from Everton in the summer of 2012, the 23-year-old is expected to re-sign for the Merseyside club, at a significant loss to City, come season's end. In speculation that might come as a surprise to everyone who had completely forgotten that Marko Marin is still a Chelsea player, Marko Marin has let it be known that he would not be adverse to severing his ties with the club. Bought from Werder Bremen 18 months ago, then farmed out on loan to Seville after a half-dozen appearances, the German midfielder told some Spanish newspaper or other that "if Sevilla and me are happy to stay I can stay here forever." And having denied his own club a penalty with the kind of heart-warming honesty that is universally lauded until a player on your team does it, Werder Bremen captain Aaron Hunt could be punished for his sportsmanship with a move to Tottenham Hotspur, who will have to do battle with Bayer Leverkusen and Borussia Monchengladbach in their attempt to bring the midfielder to north London.

The Champions League is a tough, unforgiving competition and Manchester City, once again, have been consigned to the role of jealous onlooker. This may not be the devastating, pass-the-opposition-to-death Barcelona that bewitched everyone in the Pep Guardiola years – not at the moment anyway – but this game was still a reminder about the brutalities of football at the highest level, and particularly when the opposition includes Lionel Messi. He tormented City at times. He was everywhere, always wanting the ball, and always knowing the right thing to do with it. Messi chose a good moment to remind everyone there really is no more electrifying sight in football than the four-times Ballon d'Or winner with the ball at his feet, picking up speed and hurdling challenges likes a series of invisible tripwires. It was a blur of speed and movement and the unfortunate truth for Manuel Pellegrini is that, in this company, Joleon Lescott is always likely to give his opponents something. Lescott was starting to look bewildered by the time he unwittingly played his part in the one goal that really mattered out of the three. It was delivered, off the outside of Messi's left boot, midway through the second half and an air of inevitability descended as soon as the ball reached Joe Hart's net. With City already 2-0 down from the first leg, that was the moment everybody knew the challenge was beyond them. It was an eccentric finale and the goal Vincent Kompany turned in from close range with a couple of minutes to go was never going to carry any real significance at such a late stage. Even then, however, there was one more indignity for City. Andrés Iniesta set up Dani Alves to fire his shot through a congested penalty area and that was the point virtually half the City team could be seen on their knees or lying flat-out on the turf. By that stage they were down to 10 men after another refereeing decision that will convince Pellegrini his team suffered badly over the two ties because of poor officiating. City were convinced they should have been awarded a penalty for Gerard Piqué's 78th-minute challenge on the substitute Edin Dzeko but the French referee, Stéphane Lannoy, waved play on and Pablo Zabaleta took his protests so far that he was shown a second yellow card. City had a reasonable grievance on a night when Pellegrini was already barred from the dugout because of his lacerating post-match comments about the Swedish referee Jonas Eriksson after the first leg. Yet there was more to City's defeat than trying to pin the blame elsewhere. A team cannot come to the Camp Nou and expect to win unless everyone is at their peak and the unfortunate truth is that this was probably Sergio Agüero's most undistinguished performance in City's colours. While Messi dazzled, Agüero faded away. He tried three passes in the first half and the only one that reached a team-mate was from the kick-off. He did not reappear after half-time and the club said later that he had a hamstring injury. City were much more forceful in attack once Dzeko had replaced him. Messi versus Lescott was a lop-sided contest. Early in the second half, Messi waltzed past the defender and put his shot against an upright. There had already been other warnings and the next time Lescott showed his vulnerability, unable to intercept Cesc Fábregas's through ball and inadvertently playing the final touch to Messi, it was a gift a player of this quality was not going to pass up. Barcelona had come into this game after slipping to third in La Liga, on the back of three defeats in their past six games. They had been facing intense criticism in the Catalan media and it was always going to be a case of whether City could score first and bring out any underlying sense of nervousness inside the Camp Nou. Yet Messi, slaloming past defenders, was a constant menace. Neymar, though a few grades down on his colleague, was another elusive opponent while Xavi Hernández and Iniesta orchestrated proceedings in their midfield positions. Hart had to produce a string of saves to keep the score down. City could reflect on reasonable chances for David Silva and Samir Nasri in the first half but it was not until Dzeko replaced Agüero that they started to be emboldened, playing with greater adventure. At 0-0, Dzeko's header brought a sprawling one-handed save from Víctor Valdés. Soon afterwards, Pique's saving tackle denied Fernandinho at close range. Messi, however, always shimmered with danger and his goal snuffed out any worries. Kompany's equaliser came from a corner, applying the final touch to Dzeko's header, despite Barça's protests that at least one player had been offside. The home team had other complaints about a disallowed goal for Neymar in the first half but by the end of the night that was a mere subplot. The real story was of Messi, in full flow, demonstrating to City that they still have some way to go before all that hard ambition and financial power brings them what they want.

For so long accused of wallowing in their glorious past, Liverpool are now looking to a triumphant future that edges ever nearer. Three points from a dicey assignment at Southampton means a first title in 24 years is a fantasy with an increasing chance of becoming reality. Only Chelsea are above Brendan Rodgers' swashbuckling side in the Premier League table now. In the season straight after the abdication of Sir Alex Ferguson, Liverpool could return to the perch that was once their preserve. The pressure was on Rodgers' men here. Arsenal's defeat at Stoke and Manchester City's engagement in the Capital One Cup final meant victory would propel them into second place, a challenge to which teams of less mettle would not have risen. Southampton had beaten Liverpool in their two previous meetings and posed them plenty of problems here but the visitors took the best blows that their hosts could throw and struck back with three powerful strikes. Another goal spree plus a rare clean sheet made Rodgers a happy man. "This was an outstanding and really significant performance," said the Liverpool manager, who tempered talk of the title with the inevitable one-game-at-a-time mantra. His Southampton counterpart, Mauricio Pochettino, was less coy, concluding: "Liverpool are definitely a candidate for the title, they have the right players to mount a serious challenge." Southampton forced Liverpool to prove their credentials and that made for a gripping game. From the outset both sides fizzed with endeavour and enterprise. Liverpool, who tweaked their formation to play with a midfield diamond and Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suárez as a front two, came within inches of taking the lead in the sixth minute. Sturridge raced down the right and attempted to lay the ball across to the unmarked Suárez but José Fonte stretched to poke the ball behind just as the Uruguayan prepared to pounce. Both sides began with four players named in the England squad to face Denmark on Wednesday, including the Southampton left-back Luke Shaw, who turns 19 the day before the World Cup final and played as if intent on showing the watching Roy Hodgson that he deserves to go to Brazil. With England's usual right-back, Glen Johnson, deployed on Liverpool's left, Shaw regularly galloped forward to torment Jon Flanagan, though it was Adam Lallana who went down in the box under a challenge from Flanagan in the 13th minute. The referee, Lee Probert, rejected the pleas for a penalty. Two minutes later Liverpool's scoring machine clicked into gear. Suárez had not netted for five matches prior to this but, after initiating an attack, he benefited from ricochets off two Southampton defenders before firing low into the net from 16 yards to plunder his 24th goal of the campaign. That was one demonstration that Hodgson might not have appreciated given that he has to figure out a way of stopping the Uruguayan in June. Southampton pushed Liverpool on to the back foot for most of the remainder of the first half and could have been level by half-time. Just past the half-hour Rickie Lambert knocked down a cross to Lallana, whose scuffed close-range shot rolled past Simon Mignolet but bounced out off the post. The hosts were foiled superbly by the Belgian goalkeeper just before the break, when, after a cross by Lallana and a dummy by Lambert, Jay Rodriguez let fly from eight yards, only for Mignolet to twist his body and turn the low shot away with one hand. Southampton's forward momentum continued after the resumption. Steven Gerrard, stationed in his now-familiar berth in front of the Liverpool defence, was struggling to keep track of Lallana, who tested Mignolet again in the 49th minute. Rodgers introduced Raheem Sterling in place of Philippe Coutinho in the 58th minute in a bid to reassert Liverpool's offensive power but hardly imagined that the youngster would score with his first touch. Yet after nimble interplay on the right, Suárez delivered a low ball into the box and Sterling, who was not even born when Liverpool were last champions of England, sidefooted into the net from 10 yards. Liverpool finished in jubilant form. Sturridge and Suárez could have scored again before stoppage time, when Suárez darted into the box and duped Fonte, who brought him down to concede a penalty. Gerrard scored with style.

Not a lot of love lost between these two clubs. Relations have been strained ever since Paul Lambert left Norwich for Villa in 2012 and time has not been much of a healer. A game full of subplots – Wes Hoolahan wanted to join Villa from Norwich in January while Grant Holt, who scored prolifically during his time at Carrow Road, is likely to be among the Villa substitutes – carries extra significance because both clubs are desperate for points to climb clear of the relegation scrap.

Villa have just returned from a warm weather training break in Portugal. Paul Lambert can only trust it has done them more good than last month's trip to Abu Dhabi did Newcastle. Since returning, Alan Pardew's team have failed to score a goal while conceding 10 in their last three games. With only one win in nine matches and lacking a home victory since Boxing Day, Pardew is under pressure. "Newcastle's crowd can become edgy," said Lambert.

West Ham come into this fixture having won their last three games 2-0 but they have struggled in recent meetings with Southampton, having won just one of the last eight.

It has been three months since Mark Randall claims he was last paid. The midfielder once described by Arsène Wenger as among the "next generation" for Arsenal signed a two-year deal for the Italian club Ascoli in September. But with the third-tier club, who were in Serie A as recently as 2007, declared bankrupt and having had their assets seized, the Englishman says he will terminate his contract this month in the hope of finding a new club, and a wage. "I stuck it out for as long as I could but there comes a point where you have to put your foot down," says the 24-year-old. "I've got bills to pay. You never think of that when you're a kid growing up playing for Arsenal." It has been a rude awakening for Randall. Having played in the Champions League, Premier League, League Cup and even Dennis Bergkamp's testimonial, he went on loan spells to Burnley, MK Dons, and Rotherham before being released by his parent club in 2011. Signing for Chesterfield that June, he was again released last summer. When the opportunity arose to move abroad, he jumped at it. "Everything in Italy is more technical, which suits my game. Obviously Arsenal was technical, but it's totally different football in League One and League Two. The ball is flying over your head and everyone is charging round like headless chickens. There are a lot of managers that want to run you into the ground. The lower leagues is based around gym work, fitness, and conditioning. In Italy, the coaches always want players to have a ball." In Italy, Randall found his feet immediately. On his full home debut Randall was named man of the match, setting up two goals, but it wasn't just the style of football that enamoured Randall to playing in the country. "It's more like a family. I had my birthday there; they brought me food and champagne, sung me 'happy birthday', started hugging and kissing me and I had only been there a couple of weeks. They're so different, fighting for the hairdryer, shaving their legs in the dressing-room! Not exactly Chesterfield is it? In England, there are more cliques. You go to work, get showered and go home." Randall denies that his formative spells in England's lower leagues were detrimental to his development, but agrees that players in the top English academies are probably better suited to loan spells on the continent. "Kevin Blackwell, the old Sheffield United manager while they were in the Championship, once told me after we [Arsenal] beat his team in the Carling Cup [in 2008], that he phoned Wenger the next day and asked if he could take a few of those players on loan and was turned down flat. He didn't give Kevin any players. That sums it up really." How English clubs develop their young players, especially domestic players, is a hot topic. The FA chairman Greg Dyke recently stated just after setting up his FA commission that one of the biggest problems in English football is a lack of top talent playing in overseas leagues. Feeder clubs have long been an issue in England, with the likes of Manchester United and Chelsea having to forge links with clubs in Belgium and the Netherlands, instead of building their own second team, like Barcelona B or Real Madrid Castilla in Spain. When asked why more English players don't play abroad, Randall shrugs and puffs his cheeks out. "I'm not sure. Obviously the biggest obstacle is the language barrier. At Ascoli the coaches didn't speak one word of English. I had a little whiteboard with magnets that they would show me in the office. For the first few weeks it was impossible. For any player going abroad, learning the language is essential." As a youth at Arsenal, Wenger had a profound impact on Randall and leaning forward, he visibly gushes at the opportunity to indulge in a little nostalgia. "Wenger used to come over to the youth-team pitches and watch us all the time. Pat Rice [the former assistant] would come over and often talk to Liam Brady", Arsenal's head of youth development, who coincidently had a spell at Ascoli in the 1980s. "They would want to see for themselves what was going on, what your attitude was. I can honestly say I've never seen another first-team manager show the same interest in youth players, at all the clubs I've been at since." Rising through the academy alongside Jack Wilshere and Kieran Gibbs, Randall remains "100% a Gooner", and having grown up battling a family of Tottenham supporters, there was little doubt who he was cheering in Saturday's FA Cup third round. Last season, Randall scored in the FA Cup, when Chesterfield thrashed Hartlepool 6-1 in the first-round. He watched the weekend's third-round action from his home in Milton Keynes as he considers his next step, with interest reportedly coming from Spain, Bulgaria and Latvia. As recently as 2010, Wenger described Randall as having "so much quality that I refuse to think he will not make it". Having not made it at Arsenal, does he feel he has wasted his talent? "No, playing abroad has given me a fresh start. I learned so much tactically in Italy, especially defensively, and I'm a better player now. Leaving England was part of maturing. If I was a young player at a top team again, that's what I'd do."

Malky Mackay insisted he would not bow to Vincent Tan's request to resign as manager of Cardiff City after receiving impassioned support from fans before, during and after a 3-1 defeat at Liverpool. Cardiff supporters staged a lengthy protest against Tan, the club's controversial owner who was present, following his attempt to force Mackay out of the club. The Malaysian was driven out of the Shankly Gates in a blacked-out van as fans continued to chant Mackay's name an hour after the game, and the Scot later held talks on the Anfield pitch with the chief executive of the League Managers Association, Richard Bevan. Tan refused to comment on Mackay's position after the game, except to say: "We will do what's best for the interests of Cardiff." The businessman had asked the Scot to resign or be sacked in an email, but Mackay was adamant he will not walk away from a club he took into the Premier League last season. "I will absolutely not be resigning from the football club. I don't think there is any reason why that should happen," said the Cardiff manager, who did not speak to the club's owner after the match. "That's not something that normally happens. I'll be heading back to Wales on a plane. "I will be in work if it's got anything do with me. I want to make it crystal clear that I won't be resigning as manager of the football club. I have great respect and a great relationship with the staff, the players and the fans and I'm not going to walk away from them." Mackay's name was chanted throughout by Cardiff's travelling support and he remained on the pitch to thank their efforts after the defeat, pointing to his head as he did so. He said: "I am very humbled that our fans have taken to myself, my staff and the team like they have. We have a connection with our fans. They should really be enjoying their football this season. That's why I have apologised to them for what they have had to put up with." Liverpool fans also applauded Mackay as Luis Suárez inspired a win that took their team to the top of the Premier League, and their manager, Brendan Rodgers, hailed the Scot as the finest manager in Cardiff's history. Rodgers said: "It is a sad day. Malky is a wonderful professional, he is the best manager in the history of Cardiff City, he got them promoted to the Premier League, which was worth £90m to the club, and they are now in the most competitive league in the world. They will stay up with him at the helm and he finds himself under immense scrutiny for doing an outstanding job. "It's not everyone at Cardiff, it's one guy who feels he wants to change things, and he'll be losing the best manager in Cardiff's history."

Luis Aragonés, the coach who led Spain to victory at Euro 2008, has died at the age of 75. Aragonés was a prominent and sometimes controversial figure – notoriously sparking controversy with a racist jibe at Thierry Henry in 2004 – but was also a successful coach at club level, most notably with Atlético Madrid, leading them to the La Liga title in 1977 as well as three Copa del Rey trophies. Reports in the Spanish media said Aragonés had been admitted to a Madrid clinic in the early hours of Saturday morning but died soon after. Atlético posted a tribute on their website, and will mark his death with a minute's silence before today's match against Real Sociedad. The statement read: "One of the greatest Rojiblancas legends has left us. There have been condolences from around the footballing world. Our president, Enrique Cerezo, expressed his sorrow saying: 'Luis Aragonés was a great player and coach, but above all a great person and a friend. On behalf of the whole club, I want to express our condolences to his family'." Aragonés made his name as a player with Atlético between 1964 and 1974, making more than 350 appearances, winning three league titles and also representing Spain 11 times before hanging up his boots. He then took up the reins with the Madrid club, the first of four spells at the helm in which he led them to six trophies and promotion from the Segunda Division in 2002. Aragonés also guided Barcelona to Copa del Rey success during his one season in charge of the Catalan club in 1987-88. He took charge of the national team in 2004 and was immediately the subject of controversy when he was caught on camera using racist language about Thierry Henry in a training ground conversation with Arsenal's José Antonio Reyes, saying: "Tell that black shit that you are much better than him." He was fined £2,060 by the RFEF for the incident, but later had it overturned and insisted he was not a racist. Aragonés went on to lead Spain to their first major title in 44 years at Euro 2008 the start of a hat-trick of tournament triumphs that continued under his successor, Vicente Del Bosque, at the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012. An ill-fated spell at Turkish side Fenerbahce followed, which came to an end in the summer of 2009, before Aragonés officially announced his retirement in December last year – four years after leaving his final coaching post.

From the 19th century to Upton Park. Much to Sam Allardyce's amusement, West Ham were accused of being overly defensive by José Mourinho in their 0-0 draw at Chelsea, but they will need to refine their approach for the visit of Swansea City. West Ham, who will be without Joey O'Brien after he dislocated a shoulder at Stamford Bridge, remain in the bottom three, while Swansea eased their relegation fears by beating Fulham on Wednesday, their first win in the league for eight weeks.

Tottenham Hotspur have won all three away league games since Tim Sherwood took over as manager, and they face a Hull City team that are yet to take any points in the Premier League in 2014.

You may have seen it by now, the video that started doing the rounds at the end of last week and, alongside a chorus of chuckles and belly laughs, has made stars of Liam Ying, Win Nowt, Win Ding Youup, Deanio and the tall Finnish goalkeeper, Lugi Bell. Put together by Full Time Devils, a Manchester United supporters' YouTube channel, in collaboration with Talksport, the 6min 41sec clip sees comedian Andrew Ryan approach fans outside Stamford Bridge and ask them their views on players who have been linked with a move to Chelsea. The thing is, all the supposed targets are made up – Liam Ying, a talented left-back from Crewe, is nothing more than an anagram of 'I am Lying' while the jokes behind Dutch full-back Win Nowt and South Korean prospect Win Ding Youup are pretty obvious. Deanio, meanwhile, a Brazilian Under-21 midfielder who plays for Parma, is another way of saying 'No Idea'. And Lugi Bell? 'Gullible', of course. What's remarkable is that the majority of Chelsea fans featured claim to have heard of the players and, in some cases, to have even seen them play. Ying is apparently "quick" and in possession of a "good left leg", Nowt is "imposing", Deanio has great "eye-sight of the field" while Bell, all 6ft 4in of him, "positions himself very well". It is isn't until the end of the video, and after he approaches a group of three fans outside Fulham Broadway underground station, that Ryan is rumbled as a bringer of nonsense news. Naturally much humour has been derided from the prank, one which Neil Smythe, a senior producer with Full Time Devils, says has less to do with football and more to do with men's "inability to admit they don't know or can't do something". Yet watching it there is a sense that what we have here is a symptom of a growing, very modern trend rooted in the sport; the desire to appear totally clued-up on players, teams and tactics across Europe and beyond even if, quite frankly, you don't know your Deanio from your Draxler. The recently-coined phrase used to characterise such people is a divisive one. For some, "football hipster" is the perfect way to describe someone who has as much interest in Groningen v FC Zwolle in the Eredivisie as they do Arsenal v Tottenham in the Premier League (the Chelsea fan who described Win Nowt as "imposing" also claimed to follow Dutch football), while others see it as a condescending insult, or as the Guardian's Spanish football correspondent Sid Lowe puts it: "A bitter attack from people who seem to think it's somehow wrong to have an interest other than theirs. I get it because of the Spanish's football thing, as if Madrid and Barcelona are somehow fucking left field." There is nothing wrong with a thirst for knowledge and among some fans that desire has always existed and has only been enhanced by football's globalisation and the explosion in access to a greater a number of players and clubs from a wider range of countries and continents. Via enhanced broadcasting and the scope the internet – in particular social media – gives to people to view and share reports, blogs, and videos, it is almost as easy to stay in touch with Klaas-Jan Huntelaar's form at Schalke from a three-bed semi in Grimsby as it is from a studio apartment in the centre of Gelsenkirchen. "When I started getting into football as a kid, it was during the period in which English clubs were banned from Europe, so it was like a window into a different, clandestine, untapped football," reflects the freelance European football writer Andy Brassell. "Catching five minutes of Real Madrid or even Gornik Zabrze on Sportsnight seemed incredible exotic. I used to get the atlas out and look them up. It's obviously different today. We have such incredible choice of football to watch. Accordingly, people are a lot more knowledgeable about the European game." Or not, as the Full Time Devils clip shows. In their defence, the duped Chelsea fans are unlikely to be alone in having claimed to have heard of and seen players that do not exist, and rather than mock perhaps this should be the point when someone says: "Honestly, it's OK to admit you don't know huge amounts about European and world football." Better that then make up stuff. I for one am happy to admit to a less-than-extensive knowledge of such fields. Don't get me wrong, there is a long-established interest in football from beyond these shores, ever since I became enthralled by Italia '90 as a nine-year-old. The appetite was truly whetted two years later following the introduction of Serie A coverage on Channel Four, hardly a surprise when your weekends are suddenly lit-up by Gianluca Vialli, Dejan Savicevic and Giuseppe Signori with James Richardson sitting behind a giant ice cream in the centre of Rome, holding up a copy of Gazzetta dello Sport and telling you that Internazionale are about to sign Ronaldo for a world record fee of £19.5m (or Stewart Downing in today's money). The standard teenage obsession with Championship Manager further stoked the interest but even then there was no great desire to cram my head with information regarding players and clubs from across Europe and beyond. My focus was far more on domestic football and, in particular, learning about and watching as much as possible of Liverpool, the club I have supported since the age of eight. It largely remains the case today in spite of viewing games from not just Serie A but also La Liga, Ligue 1, the Bundesliga and the Champions League on a regular basis. The interest is sizeable, the knowledge is decent but the desire for an expert grasp is simply not there. As such, it takes a rare exception such as Schalke's Kyriakos Papadopoulos to provoke me into finding out to any great detail about the next hot thing from abroad. YouTube highlights packages are avoided at all costs (it is possible to make any dud from any country look good with a well-edited montage) and instead the preference is to come across them in a live match, either on TV or in the flesh. In the pre-Twitter-buzz days that was the norm and often led to a glorious element of surprise. I knew nothing about Tony Yeboah before he moved from Eintracht Frankfurt to Leeds United in January 1995 and not much more until he scored that goal against Liverpool five months later. It was an out-of-the-blue, breathtaking moment and you wonder if the impact would have been less so if Yeboah's arrival at Elland Road had been preceded by a wealth of clips and blogs, via Twitter and elsewhere, testifying to his ability to thunder a volley in from distance. There are those who crave such details and for them this is a golden age – instant access to backstories and statistics means fans can know about an overseas player to a greater degree than the club interested in signing him. But, as Lowe adds, "people shouldn't feel that they have to know everything," and for those with a lack of desire or time to become football aficionados there is still plenty to take from the beautiful game, and certainly no need to give a man with a microphone your assessment of a Finnish goalkeeper who doesn't even exist.

England have been dealt another World Cup injury scare after Glen Johnson was ruled out of Liverpool's Champions League pursuit for an "indefinite" period by Brendan Rodgers. The Liverpool manager revealed the right-back needs to rest an ankle problem he has been carrying for some time, starting with the FA Cup fourth-round trip to Bournemouth on Saturday. But Johnson is also struggling with a groin injury that may require surgery in the buildup to the Brazil finals. No decision has been taken on whether the 29-year-old needs a groin operation, with Liverpool hoping an extended rest will ease Johnson's various ailments, but the prospect will be a concern to the England manager Roy Hodgson, who has already lost Arsenal's Theo Walcott from his World Cup plans due to a cruciate ligament injury. "Glen has played a lot of the season with injuries and really put himself out for the team, but unfortunately he is struggling with a number of injuries now," said Rodgers. "It will be indefinite really, the timeline he will be out. "He's had a real bad ankle for a period of time and just one or two other issues that haven't allowed him to be 100%. I think everyone has seen over many years the speed, fluency and how good he's been, but for part of this season he's been restricted and that's obviously been difficult for him. He has put himself out for the team, he has trained and played, but it is just at that point now where we need to get him right. There's no timeline on it. We just need to assess it and we'll take it from there." Injuries have taken an inevitable toll on Johnson's form in recent months but his absence represents a setback for Rodgers as he attempts to steer Liverpool back into the Champions League. Liverpool lost the influential Lucas Leiva for up to two months last Saturday with a knee ligament injury sustained against Aston Villa, Daniel Agger has also been sidelined with a calf problem and José Enrique is "weeks away" from returning to the problematic left-back position. Jon Flanagan, however, has returned to full training having recovered from a hamstring strain suffered before Christmas and should be fit for next Tuesday's Merseyside derby at Anfield. "I am disappointed for Lucas because he's been very important for our squad this season," the Liverpool manager added. "It was something that was innocuous really and has put him out for a few months. Hopefully he'll get back sooner rather than later. He'd been in good form this season and had worked his way back into the Brazil squad. Knowing what he is like, he'll be back sooner rather than later – and he'll do everything in his power to get back. In the meantime, that leaves us short of a really good player."

Jérôme Champagne, a former close adviser of the Fifa president Sepp Blatter, has announced that he is to stand for the presidency of the world governing body and was immediately endorsed by Pelé. Champagne, 55, made his announcement at a news conference in London where he stated he will stand for election next year. The French former diplomat is likely to face Blatter, 77, although the current president has said he will not decide whether to run for a fifth term until just before the Fifa Congress in June. In a videotaped message shown when Champagne launched his bid, Pelé said: "I cannot stay away from a debate which is so important for the future of football and thus, I support Jérôme Champagne and his vision." Pelé, 73, said the pair first met in the 1990s when he was Brazil's minister of sport and Champagne was the first secretary at the French Embassy in Brazil, and they developed "a sincere friendship". He added: "Football today enjoys a lot of success but also faces many problems requiring a strong and democratic Fifa with a vision in favour of everyone, and a governance which is both universal and modern. "Fifa must continue doing what has been done well in the past, taking its competitions and the World Cup to all countries and also continue its development programmes, but has to adapt itself to the 21st century and to the world of today." Champagne worked at Fifa from 1999 to 2010 and has since been working as an independent consultant in a number of the world's football trouble spots. The Uefa president Michel Platini is also expected to stand for the office but has yet to declare his intentions.

Liverpool dropped a couple of home points against a surprisingly dynamic Aston Villa, though at least the club's American owners saw a few goals and an entertaining game. The home side came back from two goals down to share the points on an evening that put some of the recent title talk around Anfield into perspective. It is true, as Brendan Rodgers keeps saying, that Liverpool still have to play most of the leading contenders at home, though evidently it is also the case that they cannot take results against sides lower down the table for granted. Villa won this fixture last year, and until Gabriel Agbonlahor was forced off early in the second half looked capable of doing so again. "We lost Gabby at a vital time, because he was proving unplayable," Paul Lambert said. "Some of our players put in massive performances today. I thought we could have been out of sight by half‑time." That is only a slight exaggeration. Not realising his side would soon be two goals to the good, Paul Lambert had his head in his hands just 45 seconds into the game when Villa missed a great chance to open the scoring, Agbonlahor latching on to Christian Benteke's flick but poking the ball wide in front of the Kop with only Simon Mignolet to beat. If that was a lucky escape for Liverpool then luck soon evened itself out, Leandro Bacuna surviving a penalty appeal when the ball clearly hit his arm. Villa's away kit is every bit as hideous as purple and white quarters suggests, though the visitors were no shrinking violets. They took the game to Liverpool in the early stages, with Agbonlahor and Benteke both causing problems for Kolo Touré and Martin Skrtel, and the Kop goal had another let-off when Ciaran Clark struck the foot of Mignolet's post with a firm header from a corner. With Liverpool struggling to get into their stride, Villa took a deserved lead with a well-executed counterattack. Benteke sent Agbonlahor galloping beyond Touré into space on the left, and Andreas Weimann sprinted 80 yards to supply the far-post tap-in when the cross came along the goalline. There was a suspicion of offside because Weimann had got beyond the Liverpool defenders, though replays confirmed he was not in front of his team-mate when the pass was released. Brad Guzan saved from Raheem Sterling as Liverpool attempted to get back on terms, but Villa gained further reward when Mignolet and Skrtel got in each other's way and failed to deal with an Agbonlahor cross from the right that left Benteke with a straightforward header. The ball crossed the line almost apologetically, and to make matters worse Liverpool's next chance to reply fell to Aly Cissokho just before the interval, and the defender appears to have modelled his finishing technique on a Jason Puncheon penalty. Fortunately, Daniel Sturridge does know how to find the net, and when a neat touch from Jordan Henderson turned a Luis Suárez pass into something more dangerous in stoppage time, the England striker's angled shot reduced the arrears. Rodgers made a change at half-time, sensibly deciding that this was not the game to leave Lucas Leiva on the bench, and introduced the defensive midfielder at the expense of Philippe Coutinho. The younger Brazilian lasted only 20 minutes before he too made way, for Joe Allen. Villa also made an enforced change a couple of minutes after the restart, Agbonlahor pulling up after a collision with the perimeter hoarding to allow Grant Holt the chance to make his debut. Scorer of a memorable goal here for Norwich, though considered too portly to hold down a place at Wigan, Holt had the briefest of chances to make an immediate impression before Liverpool levelled the scores from the penalty spot. Suárez touched the ball past Guzan from Steven Gerrard's inspired pass and the goalkeeper brought him down. That is what the referee decided in any case. Contact appeared to be minimal but the goalkeeper sold himself and Suárez knows what to do in those situations. Gerrard calmly stroked the ball into the bottom corner. Suárez and Henderson had shots saved as Liverpool pressed for a winner, Suárez went close with a free-kick and Bacuna was booked for cheekily wasting time by presenting the ball to a member of the crowd. On this occasion, Suárez was unable to come to Liverpool's rescue; it happens sometimes. Neither side could produce enough urgency in the final half-hour to deserve all three points. A draw was fair. Even Rodgers thought so. "It was a good point in the end," the Liverpool manager said. "We weren't great but we got something."

Someone should tell West Ham they are in a relegation battle. There is nothing shocking about a football team losing a match. Yet it was the level of West Ham's incompetence that beggared belief, especially in a first half of such staggering negligence that it was a wonder that Newcastle only scored twice. After the relief of last weekend's victory over Cardiff City, this was a reversion to type from West Ham and defeat plunged them back into the bottom three. For Sam Allardyce, there is no escape from the pressure. Newcastle, it must be said, were worthy winners and Alan Pardew relished victory against his old club. Yohan Cabaye, the man of the match by a country mile, delivered a masterclass in midfield and Loïc Rémy was a slippery, potent menace in attack. The two Frenchmen scored the goals and Newcastle's superiority was rarely disputed. Yet West Ham were so pathetic that it beggared belief that they can call themselves a Premier League side – perhaps not for long, mind you. Pardew, in a good mood after ending a four-match losing streak, was generous in his assessment that West Ham will stay up. Once again, the chance to win successive Premier League games for the first time under Allardyce was frittered away and as impressive as Newcastle were, this was as bad as anything West Ham have produced this season. Although they could point to dreadful misses from Andy Carroll and Carlton Cole in the second half in their desperate search for an equaliser, they were outclassed and well beaten. Disruption to their defence did not help. Already missing the suspended James Tomkins and the injured Winston Reid, Joey O'Brien and Guy Demel, Allardyce was dealt a further blow when George McCartney, who was supposed to play at right-back, injured his neck on the morning of the match. It meant that West Ham did not have a fit right-back and Matt Taylor, a left-footed midfielder, was shoehorned into an unfamiliar role. Surely, though, it would have made more sense to play Leo Chambers instead but the 18-year-old was named on the bench. Recognising West Ham's weakness on the right, Newcastle attacked down that side repeatedly and took the lead after 16 minutes when Yoan Gouffran drifted away from Taylor and nutmegged Mark Noble with a pass to Cabaye, who stepped past a risible challenge from Razvan Rat before caressing a lovely shot beyond Adrián. West Ham's lack of pace had already been exposed by that point; Rémy only needed to break into a light jog to get away from James Collins and Roger Johnson but his effort was deflected wide after eight minutes. Cabaye was operating on a different level, running rings around the ponderous West Ham midfield and creating countless chances, and it is crucial that Newcastle do not lose him this month. "All the managers in the transfer window are nervous," Pardew said. "Like all Premier League clubs, everybody is for sale at some price. But we've got a good team and we'll try to keep it together and push on." At times, Newcastle were brilliant. They attacked with pace and purpose, but they were guilty of some wasteful finishing too: Gouffran had a smuggled effort cleared off the line by Noble, Cabaye fired inches wide, Rémy was denied and Moussa Sissoko shot too close to Adrián. A second goal was inevitable, though, and when Taylor failed to deal with Sissoko's cross, Rémy chested the ball down and poked it past Adrián from close range after 34 minutes. That was the cue for Upton Park's fury to bubble over. West Ham had been abysmal, yet they were gifted a way back into the game just before half-time when Rat's cross reached Carlton Cole and, although his effort was blocked by Tim Krul, the ball rebounded off the striker and then off Mike Williamson, dribbling over the line for a mess of an own goal. It was a goal that defied logic and it caused Newcastle to lose their way during a frenzied 20-minute spell in the second half when Cole contrived to miss from six yards out from Taylor's cross. That was the cue for Carroll to come on but when the big man's big moment came with 15 minutes to go, he blew it. Stewart Downing's cutback from the byline was palmed out by Krul and fell to Carroll, who took stock of the situation, steadied himself, leant back and then blootered the ball into Row Z with the goal gaping. That drained the life out of West Ham and Cabaye sealed the points for Newcastle with his second goal of the game in stoppage time. He curled a free-kick over the wall and Adrián could only push the ball on to the inside of the post, and it went in. Allardyce's expression on the touchline said it all. Time is running out.

Manuel Pellegrini hailed the 99 goals his Manchester City side have scored in all competitions as Blackburn Rovers were routed 5-0 in the FA Cup third-round replay. Sergio Agüero found the net 49 seconds after coming off the bench on his return from injury and Pellegrini stated that offered him a good selection headache as Álvaro Negredo and Edin Dzeko, who started in the City attack, each scored twice. City face Cardiff City next in Saturday's Premier League game at the Etihad and Pellegrini welcomed being faced with potentially having to choose two of his three strikers. "That is not a problem," the manager said. "It is a problem when you don't have players to choose. I think that Álvaro and Edin are in a very good moment. It is very important for the team that Sergio comes back and scored. We have so many games in the future and we don't have any problem in that part of the field. We also have [Stevan] Jovetic coming back and it must be important for the team." Asked if he rated the three as the best strikeforce in Europe, Pellegrini said: "I don't think we have the three best but I think we have three top players." Of the tally of 99, he added: "It is an important amount of goals. It is important for the fans to come here to know we are going to try to play a very good game and score the most amount of goals that we can." The 99 have come from 33 matches and City average four goals a game at home, with 64 from 16 fixtures. Agüero scored City's fourth, within moments of entering as late replacement, and Pellegrini is clear he could have no sympathy with the opposition over having such a stand-out substitute. "I act without thinking of the other team," said the Chilean. "It is important for our team to keep playing in the same way, changing names but in the same style. We try to play independent of the score at that time."

Tottenham Hotspur loiter on the fringe of the Champions League places again, though even in victory this was a contest to leave Tim Sherwood scratching his head. The Spurs head coach is enjoying a crash course in Premier League management and this game took him to extremes: from fury at his side's initial shortcomings to relief in victory, presumably via a few second thoughts over the logic of selling Jermain Defoe. The England striker was afforded 32 minutes and duly scored his first Premier League goal of the season to make safe a win that had initially felt unlikely. Defoe might have been flagged for offside but, hovering with intent, he pounced as Jonathan Parr and Damien Delaney failed to clear Aaron Lennon's pass. The finish was tucked crisply over Julián Speroni and celebrated with gusto – and, given how ineffective Roberto Soldado had been before his withdrawal, the 31-year-old's £6m sale to Toronto appears even riskier. "I know Jermain will score wherever he plays, whatever league he plays in," Sherwood said. "If he doesn't score he gets the hump, but he'll go home happy tonight. He warmed up on the touchline like an Olympic athlete out there, up and down like a Trojan. I saw the appetite he was showing to come on. He made my mind up for me about bringing him on." The Premier League's loss will be Major League Soccer's gain. There are likely to be a few more reminders before Defoe departs for Canada at the end of February, with his impact required here, even if Crystal Palace had blown their big chance by then. There had been times in the first half –when Spurs had been harried off their game and the visitors cut them apart from flank to centre – when Tony Pulis must have contemplated his side breaking free of the bottom three. They actually ended the afternoon beaten, bottom and rueful of missed opportunities. Their clearest was a penalty born of Delaney's leggy burst from deep and slipped pass to Marouane Chamakh, with Mousa Dembélé's clumsy challenge yielding the foul. The striker indicated he wished to take the kick, though Jason Puncheon had scored from the spot in his team's last league outing, on New Year's Day, and took responsibility again. He ambled up to the ball, indecision gripping, and sliced it horrendously high and wide. The winger is still waiting for his loan deal from Southampton to be made permanent; this miss was untimely. Had their delivery thereafter been more accurate, Palace might still have flourished while Sherwood flapped in livid disbelief on the sidelines. But too many crosses were over-hit and, when Palace did gain sight of goal, their finishing was awry. Chamakh, who would be denied late on by Hugo Lloris, might have scored from close range, only for his shot to strike Yannick Bolasie. Adlène Guedioura, meanwhile, battered the ball just wide from distance. This has been the story of Palace's season, and bite must be recruited this month if they are to survive. Spurs had been there for the taking, the tidy Nabil Bentaleb alone in impressing and striking the woodwork from distance. They were unlikely to prove as accommodating after the break, once Sherwood had made his displeasure known. "The manager was really angry at half-time," said Christian Eriksen, whose up-turn in industry epitomised that of his team. When substitute Kyle Naughton flung a pass forward and Emmanuel Adebayor outjumped Danny Gabbidon and Adrian Mariappa, there was Eriksen, unchecked, to thump the ball into the top corner with Speroni exposed. "We'd been taken a bit by surprise by Palace," said Sherwood, who lost Kyle Walker to a calf strain. "But in the second half we matched them for desire and effort, and our quality shone through." The lead gave Spurs the opportunity to dictate the tempo, Palace's energy levels having dipped, with Eriksen revelling. Defoe's cameo added to their firepower, the England forward instantly menacing. He had already belted one shot beyond the far post when he escaped the linesman's flag to give the scoreline an air of comfort.

1) Gerrard moving forward in backward role For Steven Gerrard, Sunday's 5-3 win over Stoke City provided a glimpse into the twilight of his Liverpool career and what those years are likely to involve. Sitting just in front of the back four, Gerrard was more like a quarterback than the rampaging midfielder of old. Brendan Rodgers described it as the "controlling role" and said he has been discussing the position with Gerrard for a while, with the Liverpool manager convinced that it is tailor-made for a man who turns 34 in May. "I just feel that position is perfect for him," Rodgers said. "He's got the personality to play it. When you play in that controlling role, you need someone who can get on the ball. He gives us great variety with his passing, you saw a couple of times from deep where he opened the game up for us with his vision and quality. And I also thought he showed great leadership as well, he was sliding across, blocking lines of pass, he was dropping in, he was making headers." Stuart James • Match report: Stoke City 3-5 Liverpool • Rodgers: Liverpool are legitimate title challengers 2) Sticks and stones break your bones, words they do no harm At first glance, it is hard to connect Alan Pardew calling Manuel Pellegrini a "fucking old cunt" with the entirely untypical Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa tackle which left Samir Nasri stretchered off, his left leg in a brace protecting what is believed to be a serious knee ligament injury. Yet the anger which rose in Pardew following the pedantically disallowed Cheick Tioté goal – a technical application of the current law even if it confounded the spirit of the game – surely affected not only Newcastle's manager but transmitted itself to his players at half-time. Nasri may now face months of rehab while his team-mates likely win trophies. With Mike Jones, the referee clearly unnerved by the abuse he received for disallowing Tioté's 'goal', merely yellow carding Yanga-Mbiwa, Pardew – suddenly turning sensible – immediately substituted the defender. Newcastle's manager should reflect that not only is swearing deeply undignified for a man of 52, but that his wholly inappropriate, cringe-inducing verbal volley at Pellegrini possibly precipitated Nasri's current plight. Louise Taylor • Pardew apologises for insulting City's Pellegrini • Match report: Newcastle 0-2 Manchester City • Poll: should Cheick Tioté's 'goal' have stood? • Michael Cox: Pardew tactics impress in defeat • Man City's Agüero set to return in FA Cup tie 3) Mr Benevolence or a hard-nosed money maker? Cardiff's newly published accounts make interesting reading. Is Vincent Tan, their Malaysian owner, Mr Benevolence or a hard-nosed money maker? Of the club's eyewatering £118m debt some £66m is owed to Tan, who charges interest on it. He has promised to convert that debt into shares, but the accounts reveal that so far his largesse extends to just £2.5m-worth of shares. He has also written off £5m in interest. The club's wage bill was up from £18.5m in 2012 to £30m and a historic debt to Langston, a mysterious company fronted by Sam Hammam, was settled at a cost of £22m. A further £2.5m was paid to the Cayman Islands-based Player Finance Fund. Despite promotion, revenue fell from £20m in 2011-12 to just over £17m in 2013.

Now 32, the midfielder has not been selected for an England squad by Hodgson since pulling out of the 2012 European Championship with a groin injury, suffered ahead of the tournament. After recent friendlies came and went without a call-up, despite his commanding form for Everton all season, Barry conceded his World Cup ambitions were over. Saturday's latest offering showed he has to be worthy of consideration. Put simply, if Hodgson can allocate a space to Tom Cleverley, he should be making one for Barry.

They have conceded an average of 2.76 in the 13 since then. So no wonder Rene Meulensteen is looking forward to the Norwegian making his comeback in tomorrow's FA Cup replay against Norwich. But if this season has taught Fulham anything, it should be that pinning their survival hopes on a 32-year-old immediately regaining and sustaining his best form is not very wise. Hangeland should be welcomed back, of course, but Fulham also need to reinforce their defence through transfers. Paul Doyle • Match report: Fulham 1-4 Sunderland 6) Is age catching up with Chelsea's Cole? Ashley Cole has been a fine servant to Chelsea, Arsenal and England over the years but at 33, the years are beginning to catch up with him. Twice in the opening stages at Hull he was challenged to a foot race by Ahmed Elmohamady, and on both occasions the Tigers' winger won. The fact that Elmohamady made nothing out of either opportunity is just one of the problems facing Steve Bruce. Elmohamady's final ball has never been great, his crossing is unreliable and until Bruce beefs up the Hull front line there is often no one to aim a cross at in any case. But he undoubtedly had the beating of Cole on Saturday and Hull were unable to take advantage. Better teams might, though at least Cole had a good day going forward. His delicate backheel set up the opening goal for Eden Hazard, and he also instigated the best Chelsea move of the first half, when Oscar should have supplied a better finish in front of goal. Paul Wilson • Match report: Hull City 0-2 Chelsea • Sean Ingle: Cole challenged by new generation 7) Who needs Van Persie? Danny Welbeck's second in Manchester United's 2-0 win over Swansea City was a ninth of the campaign. Six of these have come in the nine games he has played since Robin van Persie went down injured on 10 December and Welbeck was played in his natural position of striker. When Van Persie will return from his thigh problem is a conundrum but perhaps the answer's importance recedes as a simpler equation emerges: if Welbeck plays up front he scores. The longer the 23-year-continues to perform, the greater chance of David Moyes starting to ask: 'who needs Van Persie?' Jamie Jackson • Match report: Manchester United 2-0 Swansea • Evra set to leave Old Trafford in June 8) Tottenham should resist dipping into the market Tim Sherwood's impact has been immediate on Tottenham Hotspur's league form, with 13 points gained from a possible 15 to date, to hoist Spurs back to the brink of the Champions League qualification places. What makes that record all the more impressive is the revival has been achieved without the key personnel who have been cluttering up their treatment room. Yet those walking wounded are now returning to the fold. "A lot of them are training again," said the head coach. "Younès Kaboul is very soon into his return, and only Jan Vertonghen and Paulinho are still 'injured'. The rest are training, but I'm not one to rush them in too quickly because that's a recipe for disaster. We've seen that in the past with Sandro and Younès: when you haven't had the conditioning work, they end up sitting out another eight weeks." Yet if this is a time for patience in terms of restoring those players to the team, then it is also a time to resist adding to the group. Spurs love to wheel and deal in a transfer window, their instinct forever to sniff out a bargain. But, even with Jermain Defoe leaving next month, surely they boast enough in terms of numbers already. Sherwood's stance has shifted slightly on the issue: initially he had suggested "the last thing we want is more players", though on Saturday he offered the caveat "I'm not saying we won't go after someone". Yet the summer would be a better time to determine where he needs to tweak. This squad should be allowed to develop under new management until then. Dominic Fifield • Match report: Tottenham 2-0 Crystal Palace • Video: Sherwood on Defoe and Premier League • Daniel Taylor: Defoe is heading for a dead end 9) Southampton regain their defensive solidity "I think the team as of late has been playing better, but it has been lacking defensive solidity," nail-on-the-headed Southampton's Mauricio Pochettino after the 1-0 win over West Bromwich Albion. "Today we recovered that, we recovered that winning spirit, we recovered that solidity at the back." They also recovered Artur Boruc and his return played no small part in their win. With just seconds left on the clock, Liam Ridgewell broke down the right-hand side and squared the ball for Shane Long, who, just moments earlier, had accepted an award for the freedom of the Southampton penalty area. At this point, the home fans must have had their heads in their hands and been muttering dark curses about the shortcomings of their defence because there was no way from six yards out that a striker of Long's quality was going to miss. But then all of a sudden, like a monster emerging from the mist, stood the Polish keeper as wide as Jabba the Hutt and as tall as Frankenstein. An unmissable chance soon became an unscoreable one and Saints left with three points in their pocket. There have been other injuries at the back but Boruc is the proverbial glue that holds it all together for them and thus it was no surprise that the Saints generally defended with more vigour to keep only their second clean sheet since late October. After the defeat to Chelsea, Southampton played seven league games without Boruc, lost four, drew two and won just once, conceding 13 goals. In the seven before that game, they won four, drew two and lost just once, letting in a mere five goals. Those fans must be happy to have him back. Ian McCourt • Match report: Southampton 1-0 West Brom • West Brom's Long trying to ignore transfer rumours 10) Puncheon penalty raises a sadistic smile There was Japp. And there was Chris. And there was Harry and, of course, there was David and Neymar and Francesco and Will and Diana. And then there was Jason. Oh Jason. Jason, Jason, Jason. It was almost impressive to miss in such a manner. It was not even within a country mile of being close to close. Given that his spurned opportunity meant Crystal Palace passed up a golden opportunity to take an early lead, most Palace fans probably won't see the funny side. But when climate change consumes our world, boiling our waters, melting our buildings, burning our crops and there is but one last, final football fan left standing amidst the debris of our once pulchritudinous planet, they will still be able to raise a smile at the thought of that penalty.

Game by game Atlético Madrid have arrived at the game. On Saturday night, Barcelona visit the Vicente Calderón stadium, down on the banks of the Manzanares. It is week 19, marking the halfway point of the season when everyone has played everyone else, and the reward for victory is the top of the table, a significant lead going into the back 19. The country's two outstanding teams meet at last, another Madrid-Barcelona presented as a title-decider. Only this time the Madrid in question is Atlético. For weeks, eyes have been drawn to this match; for weeks, months even, coach Diego "El Cholo" Simeone has been asked about it, about his side's chances of achieving what no one has achieved in a decade and win the title ahead of Barça and Madrid. With each passing match, the question becomes more insistent. Now can you win the league? Every time, he insists that his team are progressing partido a partido, game by game, while describing winning the league as impossible. The cliche is not new but it has become his, almost as if Simeone invented it; game by game has become a running joke. Simeone refused to get ahead of himself and game by game has been good for his team. This was always going to be a huge match but, in truth, few expected Atlético to reach this point quite so well positioned: level on points with Barcelona, five ahead of Real Madrid: 18 games played, 16 wins, one draw and a solitary defeat which came thanks to a fluke own goal at Espanyol. They have conceded just 11 goals all season and scored 47. "This league is boring: Madrid and Barcelona will be ahead. As games go by you'll see I'm right," Simeone said after that loss at Espanyol, repeating his mantra from the start of the campaign. But the games pass one by one, and Atlético are still there. If they win on Saturday, Simeone will be asked again: And now? The response will probably be the same, but the sensations will surely be different. Those who have resisted the belief that Atlético really can win the league may convert too. Diego Simeone took over two days before Christmas 2011. Atlético had just been knocked out of the Copa del Rey by third-tier Albacete. Over the years, a legend had built up that had Atlético as el pupas, the jinxed one. What could go wrong would go wrong: losing the European Cup final to a fluke goal, getting relegated, always, always losing to their city rivals. The legend served as an excuse, a convenient smokescreen for failure, and it wasn't always true: Atlético had won the Europa League in 2010. But it was true that Atlético were a club in almost permanent crisis, a state of confusion and conflict, fractured, fragile and fatalistic. Simeone has changed everything, the club's very identity. Captain of Atlético's double-winning side in 1996, carrying a unique moral authority, he brought the club together: fans, management, board. "I'm not sure if he was the only one who could do that but he was certainly the best placed," the club captain Gabi told Panenka magazine. Gabi, brought up in Atlético's youth system, had played with Simeone. He explains: "El Cholo had the fans on his side because of the memory he had left as a player, an idol. He knew the board because they had had him as a player. And he knew what he had in the squad. He had all the support necessary. But that was a double-edged sword, because if results had not been good he would have gone from hero to failure. "We were sunk mentally," Gabi admits. Three-thousand fans came to Simeone's presentation. "They'll turn on me too if we lose," he told the players; they were in this together. There was talent in the team, but Simeone changed their mentality. Few represent that change in mentality like the striker Diego Costa: he joined Atlético in 2007 but went on loan to Celta, Albacete, Valladolid, Rayo and only a serious injury prevented a permanent sale. Nurtured by Simeone, this summer for the first time he knew where he would be playing. His best ever goalscoring return in the league was 10. He has 19 already. Five of them have been provided by Koke: no combination has been as productive in the league. "Atlético play like Diego Simeone played: tough, focused and tactically perfect," the Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said in the buildup to the city derby earlier this season. The following night, Atlético won 1-0. It was their second successive win at the Bernabéu, for the first time ever. The first, their first of any sort against Madrid in 25 games going back 14 years, had been in the final of the Copa del Rey four months before. Some considered it the biggest victory in their history. In two years under Simeone, Atlético have won the Europa League, the European Super Cup and the Copa del Rey. They returned to the Champions League, winning five, drawing one, and conceding just three. Now they've beaten club records – and, together with Barcelona, league ones too – despite having a budget a fifth of the size of the big two. Those resources – Atlético have a shorter squad that may not assimilate injuries – could cost them but so far the collapse has stubbornly refused to come. Barcelona are one of the few sides to resist. Three times Atlético have played them in the league under Simeone, three times they have lost. But they are improving: in August they met twice in the Spanish Super Cup and Barcelona only took the title on away goals after two draws, 1-1 at the Calderón, 0-0 at the Camp Nou. Now, Atlético stand level with them at the top, racking up 49 points. Game by game. On Saturday night, the deadlock must be broken; Saturday night is the game.

Brendan Rodgers will demand an explanation for Howard Webb's decision not to award Liverpool a "blatant" penalty after Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain appeared to knock over Luis Suárez in the Arsenal box at a "defining moment" in a thrilling FA Cup fifth-round tie. If a spot-kick had been given Liverpool would have had an ideal opportunity to equalise six minutes after pulling the score back to 2-1, thanks to a penalty that Steven Gerrard converted after a previous foul on Suárez. But, to Rodgers' bitter disappointment, Webb deemed Oxlade-Chamberlain's clumsy-looking challenge to have been fair. "You can't change it but I'll speak to an assessor or someone because it would be nice to know why it wasn't given," said Rodgers, who wondered whether the fact that the incident happened so soon after the first penalty played a part in Webb's decision. "For the first one Luis was clipped and the second one was even clearer. Howard was in a great position. I'm not sure whether it was because it was so quickly after the first one. It looks a blatant penalty, so we're bitterly disappointed to have not got that because that would have kept our momentum going for the final stages, when we were on top." Suárez has been accused of simulating fouls in the past but Rodgers believes that his striker is unjustly maligned and opponents regularly get away with illegally stopping him. He cited an unpunished foul in the box by Samuel Eto'o on the Uruguayan during Liverpool's Premier League defeat at Stamford Bridge as another example. "We're a team that is really aggressive in our attacking and we provoke a lot of challenges," he said. "Especialy Luis, who is always in and around the box and asking questions of defenders. Quite a lot of the time he doesn't get what he deserves. The one at Chelsea was a clear penalty. If it is a penalty it should happen, irrespective of what reputation he's got. I thought that was quite an easy decision to make [against Arsenal]." Arsène Wenger, however, was not convinced. The Frenchman, who famously attempted to sign Suárez last summer, suggested the striker may have been guilty of exaggerating. "Honestly, you know I rate Suárez as a player but, if we had him in our team, we would have a few more free-kicks," he said. "It's always difficult to know with him if it is really genuinely contact. It was contact, I do not deny. But he is very good at making more of it every time." Webb was also criticised by Arsenal fans for not sending off Gerrard after the midfielder, who had already been booked, chopped down Oxlade-Chamberlain near the Liverpool corner flag late in the match. Rodgers felt the referee was right that time. "Of course it wasn't," he replied when asked whether he thought Gerrard's tackle deserved a second booking. He then laughed knowingly, aware that would draw allegations of hypocrisy, before explaining: "Nowadays with every challenge everyone talks about it having to be a yellow card. It was a foul but I'm not so sure it was worth a yellow. Howard's used his common sense because the player [Oxlade-Chamberlain] was going nowhere." Rodgers was pleased with his team's "outstanding" performance, noting with some justification that Liverpool could have scored "five or six more goals" but ultimately Arsenal's superior finishing saw the north London club through to the next round, where they will face Everton at the Emirates Stadium. Wenger described the victory as a perfect response to the 5-1 humbling that his team suffered against the same opponents at Anfield last week and the ideal preparation for Wednesday's Champions League showdown with Bayern Munich. "It was vital to respond to the disappointing performance at Liverpool last week," he said. "I'm very pleased with the intensity, commitment and determination. You could feel a clinical desire in my team to take every opportunity."

Manchester City beat Norwich 7-0 in November and this return fixture could well yield a similar outcome. City's away form is no longer a concern, whereas Norwich have won only one of their last 11 games in all competitions.

Manuel Pellegrini has claimed that Barcelona will be concerned at drawing Manchester City in the Champions League last 16, because the Catalan clubs are not as strong as they were a few years ago and his own side showed their strength with last week's win at Bayern Munich. The tie means Txiki Begiristain, City's director of football, and the chief executive, Ferran Soriano, will face their former club for the first time since leaving. Soriano was at Barça for five years before his resignation in 2008, having been one of several directors to offer a vote of no confidence in Joan Laporta, the then president. Begiristain departed in 2010 when Laporta did. The opening leg against the four-times European Cup winners is at the Etihad Stadium, where City are in rampant form, on 18 February. The return at the Camp Nou is on 12 March. "I think they will be very concerned," Pellegrini said. "Not only because we beat Bayern Munich. They know Manchester City is a strong team and it will be difficult for them. Barcelona is not the team it was two years ago. We will see how they arrive in February." Asked why are they are not the same side, the City manager said: "I don't know exactly what happened inside Barcelona. They changed three managers in the last three years, maybe the performances of the players are not the same, maybe the players are older. There are a lot of reasons why teams change their performance. They continue to be a very good team. Two years ago they were more unbeatable than today." Lionel Messi, the four-times world player of the year, holds no fears for Pellegrini. "It's not impossible but difficult. Last year, Messi played against Bayern Munich and they lost that," he said of the German side's 7-0 trouncing of Barcelona in the semi-final. City have become an imperious force at the Etihad, with Saturday's 6-3 humiliation of Arsenal there following a 4-1 victory over United, a 6-0 win against Tottenham Hotspur, the 7-0 rout of Norwich City and the 4-0 defeat of Newcastle United. Pellegrini would not be drawn on whether the record will scare Barcelona. "I suppose they know about that but you can't always expect to score five, six, seven goals at home," he said. Gerardo "Tata" Martino, Pellegrini's opposite number, insisted that City would not have wanted to meet his side. "I imagine that they won't be happy to have got Barcelona, either," he said. "The most important thing is to be in good shape when we get to February. Sometimes, the team you get is one team in December and another one by February. The team is the same but they can be in different form." Pellegrini has had success in the competition when at Villarreal and Málaga, reaching a semi-final and two quarter-finals. He can also point to success in La Liga, winning at the Camp Nou. "With Villarreal we won there. I finished second after Barcelona one season in Spain." Begiristain said: "I would have preferred a different opponent but I am very happy to go back to Barcelona and see old friends again. They are both teams that play good football so a spectacle is guaranteed." Pellegrini responded to the criticism he drew after his miscalculation of the match situation at Bayern. "I recognised I made an error, a normal error because I repeat I thought we needed a three-goal difference," he said. "But to have consequences in the future, I don't think there are any because we tried to scored a fourth goal." He denied that having to face Barcelona, an easier second-placed opponent, was actually a consequence. "Not of not knowing," said Pellegrini. "I made a mistake but we couldn't score four goals – its different. A mistake would be if we thought three goals was enough. If we tried to score five or four and couldn't do it, it's not a mistake." The injury suffered by Sergio Agüero, who has 19 goals in 20 appearances, is a blow before the festive period. "I think he will be at least one month out," Pellegrini said. The forward tweeted: "It's confirmed – my calf injury will leave me out for at least a month. The good news is recovery work starts today! We started with therapeutic massages on the area and some bike work. I'll keep you posted. Thanks for the support!"

Arsène Wenger admitted to "regret" and a moment of "doubt" after Arsenal's 2-0 Champions League defeat at Napoli, which has raised the prospect of a nightmarish tie in the last 16. Arsenal qualified only as Group F runners-up and they will now face either Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Atlético Madrid or Paris St-Germain. The manager, though, hopes fortune will finally smile on his club when Europe's best teams go into the draw in Switzerland on Monday. Arsenal have drawn Bayern, Milan and Barcelona at the first knockout stage in the past three seasons and lost each time. "Of course, to finish second makes the potential draw more difficult," Wenger said. "Maybe this year we will be a bit luckier [although] if you look at the teams, you know we will have a difficult draw. "On the other hand, we have qualified for the 14th consecutive year for the last 16. Maybe number 14 will give us a bit of luck. There is regret. That is the frustration because you feel it was open for us to do better. But it could have been worse tonight as well." When Mikel Arteta was sent off in the 77th minute, shortly after Gonzalo Higuaín had put Napoli 1-0 up, that worst-case scenario came into view, as a three-goal defeat would have put Arsenal out of the competition. "When we were down to ten men and 1-0 down, then doubt crept in a little bit," said Wenger. "It was a difficult moment. "We concentrated, but we were a bit in between – 'Do we attack or do we defend?' It is always difficult to cope with that problem. In the second-half, our legs went a bit and Napoli were sharper."

If you're having problems trying to fill the scoresheet, who better to come up against than Sunderland? Tottenham's modest collective goal effort edged one ahead of the Premier League's leading scorer Luis Suárez – 15 to 14 – with help from the hosts, whose not-so-secret Santas again came bearing gifts. Their unwanted benevolence this season continues, John O'Shea inadvertently making it five own goals conceded by the Premier League's bottom side, more than double any other top flight club. Surrendering the lead to lose to one former employer is unfortunate, doing it twice within the space of three days is downright careless. Yet that is the uncomfortable scenario faced by Gus Poyet, the Sunderland head coach formerly on the payroll at White Hart Lane, and in the wake of their midweek defeat to Chelsea, the South American saw another opportunity for his side to add to their meagre points tally go begging. Sunderland failed to build on Adam Johnson providing them with the lead, to leave them five points adrift of safety and their seven-season tenure of English football's top table looking increasingly at risk. For their part, Tottenham are up to sixth, two points shy of the Champions League places after responding to their humiliating defeat at Manchester City with three wins and a draw. Crisis? What crisis? "It's been a great fortnight since the Manchester City defeat, and we're back on track," André Villas-Boas insisted. Tottenham are three points behind second-placed Liverpool, whom they face next, and the Portuguese manager added: "We knew we needed to do better than we showed against City, and it's credit to the players who've been immense in the situation we've faced. It's their sweat on the pitch and they've honoured the fans and the badge on the shirt." Tottenham may still not have scored more than two goals in a league game this season but that didn't prevent them from sealing an 11th win in their past 19 away league trips, courtesy of O'Shea's untimely deflection past Vito Mannone as the Irishman was unable to avoid a cross from Mousa Dembélé, after the midfielder easily rounded Jack Colback down the left just after the interval. Jermain Defoe came close to embellishing the margin of victory, the forward suffering misfortune on two occasions when a close-range header from Aaron Lennon's centre and a deft touch from an Andros Townsend assist both came back off the post. There was no such bad luck when Defoe pulled a shot narrowly wide when released by Lewis Holtby's astute pass, a glaring miss for a marksman usually so assured when there remains only the goalkeeper to beat. "It's been our problem this season," Villas-Boas conceded. "We've been unlucky in front of goal and we could have extended our lead, but in fairness, there was only going to be one winner. We need to find a ruthlessness in front of goal." Tottenham's continued wastefulness could have proved costly. The visiting substitute Sandro escaped with what appeared to be handball in the area, and the home substitute Fabio Borini might have done rather better when attempting to direct a close-range chance through a crowd of players in a late goal-mouth melee. Instead, the Italian's effort found the welcoming arms of Hugo Lloris, whose ineffectual punch had landed invitingly for Johnson to break the deadlock eight minutes before half-time with an impressive close-range finish. Tottenham levelled before the interval, Nacer Chadli underlining his aerial threat by heading Kyle Walker's free-kick back across the six-yard area for Paulinho to stab home a second league goal this season, as O'Shea and Phil Bardsley both hesitated. Poyet had clearly left his side in little doubt as to his displeasure at the unacceptable level of their performance. "I don't know what to say," he admitted. "I'm running out of words, because the second half wasn't good enough, and there's a long list of basics we're not doing. "We'll be back in training on Monday morning and I'll keep going at them like a hammer. Either they learn quickly, or they will end up with a massive hole in their head."

The FA insists it is "very relaxed" after the kick-off time for England's opening World Cup match against Italy in the heat of Manaus was moved three hours forward following lobbying by television broadcasters. The decision, which means the game on 12 June will now kick off at 6pm local time – 11pm in the UK – may please England fans back home but will increase concerns about the effect of the conditions on the national team's players. Roy Hodgson had said after Friday's draw that he would prefer it if the match was not brought forward from its 9pm kick-off time, which would have meant UK viewers tuning in at 2am BST. The manager has long been concerned about the heat in the Amazonian city, which has average temperatures of 33 degrees in June and humidity of 80% or more even in the evening. However, following consultation with broadcasters including the BBC and ITV, Fifa moved the kick off as one of seven changes to the schedule. "We have been informed by Fifa of the change in kick-off time to ours and a number of other fixtures," said Club England's managing director, Adrian Bevington. "Roy is aware, we are very relaxed about it and will continue to make the necessary preparations." Fifa said that conditions would be similar at 6pm but it is likely the temperature and humidity will be slightly greater in the early evening. However, the FA is reassured by the fact that England are playing European opposition. Italy will also have to cope with the humid conditions. The other changes involve Ivory Coast v Japan on 14 June moving from 7pm to 10pm, Cameroon v Croatia shifting from 3pm to 6pm on 18 June and Spain v Chile moving from 7pm to 4pm on the same day. On 22 June, the USA v Portugal will shift to 6pm from 3pm, Belgium v Russia will now kick off at 1pm rather than 7pm and South Korea will play Algeria at 4pm instead of 1pm. The changes are believed to have been driven by the needs of Fifa's broadcast partners in the largest markets. ITV, which shares World Cup rights with the BBC, will have first pick of England's games when the matches are divided up . They are expected to pick England's first and third games in group D against Italy and Costa Rica, leaving the BBC with the group tie againstUruguay on 19 June.

Rene Meulensteen will have been encouraged by aspects of his new team's approach against Spurs in midweek, with Fulham revitalised by a younger selection even in suffering a sixth successive league defeat. But he had bad news on Brede Hangeland's sciatic nerve problem after the defender visited a specialist: "They're going for the surgery, which will keep him out for at least six weeks." Against Aston Villa, Fulham need rewards to accompany a re-energised display. They would do well to be wary of their visitors, impressive victors at St Mary's on Wednesday where they bit three times on the counterattack to jettison Southampton's unbeaten home record. Gabriel Agbonlahor's pace on the break will threaten the hosts, With Villa's confidence growing, this could be awkward.

Before a reunion with Didier Drogba in midweek, José Mourinho must focus on overcoming a spirited Everton side who defeated them at Goodison back in September. John Terry is back after a muscle injury and Gary Cahill is in contention despite a thigh problem. For Everton, Romelu Lukaku is ineligible against his parent club, while Steven Naismith will play some part after a head injury.

Cardiff's home form has kept them alive, with 16 of their 22 points coming at their own stadium. And with four of their remaining six home fixtures, starting today, against teams residing in the bottom half, a result is needed here if they are to climb to safety. Hull are in a precarious position: win and they could be 10th but defeat would draw them towards the bottom three.

Mesut Özil has apologised to fans after Arsenal's defeat to Bayern Munich in Wednesday night's 2-0 Champions League last-16 defeat. The German midfielder missed a crucial first-half penalty when the score was 0-0 and faded badly thereafter. "The next morning doesn't feel better either. Sorry guys – it wasn't planned that way," he wrote on his official Facebook page. "Outnumbered it was really hard to win against this team." Özil joined Arsenal from Real Madrid in a £43m deal in the summer but has been off form recently. The Arsenal manager, Arsène Wenger, admitted after the game that his confidence suffered following the penalty miss. "I think it affected Mesut. He was still shaking his head five or 10 minutes after that," said Wenger. "It had a huge impact on his performance. Confidence is your petrol in the team – it gives you the desire to play."

For Arsenal it was a night with heavy consequences. They gave everything but there was an air of inevitability after Wojciech Szczesny's sending-off and it will need something remarkable now to spare them from going out of the competition at this stage for the fourth year in succession. If there is a glimmer of hope, it is that Arsène Wenger's side won 2-0 at the Allianz Arena last season. Equally it is unlikely Bayern will be as demob happy as they were that night, already 3-1 up from the first leg. Pep Guardiola's side have control of this tie, via second-half goals from Toni Kroos and Thomas Müller, and established themselves into a position of command after a night that will consume Wenger with regret. More than anything he will look back at what happened seven minutes from the end of a chaotic first half when Szczesny left his goal-line and brought down Arjen Robben for the turning point of the match. Yet that was not the only moment to fill Wenger with anguish. Mesut Özil got it horribly wrong when he had the chance, eight minutes in, to give Arsenal a wonderful start from the penalty spot. His attempt to beat Manuel Neuer was poor, to say the least, and he faded badly during those moments when Kroos and Philipp Lahm took control of the game. Wenger said his record signing was badly affected by the penalty but a £42.5m player should have more strength of personality and Özil's latest ordeal of a mixed season finished with Mathieu Flamini berating him after the final whistle. The red card incensed Wenger so much he could be seen remonstrating with Robben and gesturing that it was a dive. Yet there was no doubt Szczesny had chopped down Bayern's elusive, often brilliant, wide man as he ran beyond Arsenal's line of defence after Kroos's clever up-and-under. The issue was whether it was a clear opportunity to score. Robben did not seem to have the ball under control and on that basis Arsenal were probably entitled to feel the Italian referee, Nicola Rizzoli, should have brandished only a yellow. What followed was extraordinary, bearing in mind Özil had already demonstrated how not to take a penalty, on an occasion of this significance. Lukasz Fabianski, replacing the unfortunate Santi Cazorla, insisted on a touch of the ball before David Alaba could take aim. With the substitution and all the recriminations, Alaba had already been waiting a full two minutes and succeeded only in skimming the outside of the post. Even then the relief of the Arsenal crowd was interspersed with an overwhelming sense of foreboding. Bayern are formidable opponents at the best of times but, with an extra man, nobody could be surprised about the way a team of this refinement took over. Guardiola made a key switch at half-time, moving Lahm from defence into midfield, and that had a considerable impact. Kroos took his goal brilliantly, in keeping with an outstanding performance. Robben was a constant menace and it says something about Bayern when they can bring on Müller as a substitute. Bastian Schweinsteiger did not even get off the bench. Arsenal, in stark contrast, began the night with a 21-year-old in attack who had started only one match all season, with 11 career goals to his name. Yaya Sanogo was raw and largely ineffective on a night when Wenger insisted Olivier Giroud's absence was not a punishment for off-field issues. Sanogo was not lacking in effort but, however it is dressed up, a team with genuine aspirations of winning this competition cannot be so frail in their choices. The other unfortunate truth for Arsenal is that, at this level, they cannot be as generous as Özil was from the penalty spot. Jack Wilshere had slipped the ball through Javi Martínez's legs and sent Özil running into the penalty area. A beautifully executed check enticed the foul from Jérôme Boateng but Özil's night swiftly unravelled. Neuer was wise to his attempt to play the ball through the middle, jutting out his right hand to deflect the shot away. Wenger commented that he could still see Özil shaking his head 10 minutes afterwards. In hindsight it would probably have been better for Arsenal if Wenger had removed him, rather than Cazorla, to bring on Fabianski. Arsenal's disappointment was exacerbated by the fact they had set off like a side that barely cared a jot for the reputation of their opponents. They were quick to the ball, slick with their passing and, at times, they pinned Bayern back. "The first 10 to 15 minutes Arsenal played incredibly," Guardiola said. "We were lucky the best goalkeeper in the world showed his qualities." Yet nobody could have expected Arsenal to continue in that manner once they had gone a man down. Bayern, 16 points clear in the Bundesliga, have far too much about them. The second half was brutal for Arsenal, starting off with Kroos curling a wonderful shot into the top corner from 20 yards. Lahm had set up his team-mate and, drifting in from the right, Bayern's captain also created the second, crossing for Müller to score with an expertly taken header. Bayern should also have had a penalty after Laurent Koscielny's trip on Müller. The two sides meet again in Munich on 11 March and from here Arsenal require one of the great nights of the Wenger reign.

It was the night Emmanuel Adebayor made his return to football, as a substitute for Crystal Palace, but it was another attacking signing from the January transfer window who made the difference to earn Bournemouth a precious victory. Bournemouth spent £10m to take Benik Afobe, the former Arsenal trainee, from Wolverhampton Wanderers and although these are very early days, he has already provided a return on the investment. He was largely quiet here and he was also guilty of missing a gilt-edged chance in the 25th minute, following which Palace went up to the other end to open the scoring through Scott Dann. But Afobe still found the way to manufacture a third goal in four matches for his new club and it proved to be the winner. Marc Pugh had scored a lovely equaliser, marked by trickery and a rasping low finish and the happiness was etched all over the features of Bournemouth’s manager, Eddie Howe, afterwards. This was his team’s fifth win in 10 Premier League games and the slivers of daylight to the bottom three places are getting wider. For Palace, there was only bitter frustration and it was summed up by Alan Pardew’s reaction. It was frenetic and frequently bad-tempered and the Palace manager was furious that the Bournemouth right-back, Adam Smith, had only been booked, rather than sent off, for an 84th minute trip on Jordon Mutch, as the Palace substitute burst through. Bournemouth did appear to have a covering defender. Pardew had been incensed that Stoke City’s Stephen Ireland had escaped censure from the referee, Mark Clattenburg, in Saturday’s FA Cup tie here for a heavy challenge on Yohan Cabaye, which has put the key Palace midfielder out for a few weeks with an ankle injury. “I spoke to Mike Riley [the referees’ chief] about Clattenburg because the guy on Saturday should get sent off,” Pardew said. “No one gets sent off against us, no one. You’ve got to really commit murder to get sent off against Crystal Palace. No one gets sent off here. We had a one-on-one tonight. I don’t know how far the covering player was. The one on Saturday was a definite sending-off, which Mike Riley agreed with me on.” Palace missed Cabaye’s composure and their injury problems are mounting up. Pardew lost James McArthur at half-time and, having made all three of his substitutions, he saw Jason Puncheon pull his hamstring, the player having to soldier on. “It was just one of those nights,” Pardew said, as he also bemoaned profligacy in front of goal from his players. At least one of them scored – for the first time in a league match for 567 minutes; the team’s only other reward during the past seven games in the competition had been an own goal by Tottenham Hotspur’s Jan Vertonghen. Palace have taken just two points from the last available 21. Pardew, however, would be misguided to think that the referee, Mike Jones, was the root cause of his team’s problems. There was plenty of directness and bluster from them but not enough cohesion. His players were often as edgy as the home crowd, and it was a waste of their energy to scapegoat Jones, however much they felt that he ignored the close attention Bournemouth paid to Wilfried Zaha. The Palace winger showed off some of his wonderful tricks in tight spaces and he went down on several occasions – to the fury of the Palace support. But, having been booked for dissent in the first-half, there was a moment during the second-half when Zaha looked to have lost his head entirely. Adebayor, who joined Palace as a free agent and came on in the 58th minute for only his sixth professional appearance since November 2014, flickered and he almost fashioned a dramatic injury-time equaliser. His shot, however, after a left-wing cross had broken for him, flashed into the side netting. Moments earlier, another Palace, substitute, Marouane Chamakh, had a close-range effort well saved by Artur Boruc. Dann’s goal came when he turned home Zaha’s driven cross, after a wonderful back-heeled set-up by Lee Chung-yong but Bournemouth, who did not deserve to be behind, hit back through Pugh. He tricked Dann one way and then the other before placing a low shot into the far corner. It was Afobe who was decisive. Matt Ritchie’s shot was beaten away by Wayne Hennessey but the Bournemouth man of the moment craned his neck to loop a header into the corner of the net.

Tom Cleverley has told Everton the only way to alleviate anxiety inside Goodison Park and criticism of the club’s young talent is by improving results. Roberto Martínez’s team host Newcastle United having failed to win their last five Premier League matches at Goodison since a 4-0 defeat of Aston Villa on 21 November. Frustration has inevitably grown during that barren spell and Martínez conceded after the 2-1 defeat by Swansea City that: “We are not enjoying playing at home.” His team have collected 13 points at Goodison this season, 16 away, and no Premier League team have conceded more on home soil than Everton’s 22. The Everton manager claimed a fear factor contributed to the Swansea display, with John Stones among those criticised for their performances. Cleverley, however, no stranger to disapproval during his time at Manchester United, admits it is the team’s responsibility to repair the atmosphere at Goodison by winning matches. “I definitely know what it’s like,” said the England international. “Now I feel like I am one of the older players and I am trying to pass advice on to the younger ones who are experiencing a bit of stick for the first time. “I feel like I can help. How do you get through it? You start winning football matches. That is the only thing that can change it. We aren’t the only set of players taking some stick. I’m sure two wins next week can sort that out. “It’s a give-and-take relationship with the team and the supporters. We have got to put performances in and hopefully they will be with us all the way. That is the only thing that football clubs can do. It is not my place to start giving advice to the fans but we have got to stick together. You do feel it [the atmosphere] but it is something that footballers have got to deal with. I have experienced it at both ends of the spectrum. I have had the pressure of title races and the pressure of relegation battles. One thing we are is entertaining. If we can turn the entertainment into results, I’m sure everyone will enjoy the rest of the season.” Cleverley has made an encouraging start to his Everton career, albeit with injury disrupting the first half of the campaign, and it was his stoppage-time header at Newcastle on Boxing Day that gave Martínez’s side their last Premier League win. The midfielder concedes: “I thought our luck was changing on Boxing Day but it hasn’t been the case. It has been frustrating and last Wednesday [at Manchester City in the Capital One Cup semi-final)] was a really frustrating night. Everyone realises there have been five or six games that we have not seen out. We have been a tad unlucky but everyone at the club feels we should be higher than where we are. But we are not feeling sorry for ourselves. We set a marker down; Carlisle United [beaten 3-0 in the FA Cup on Sunday)] was the beginning of the second half of the season and we want to make it a successful one.” Martínez has praised the League Two club, and their supporters, for the reaction to alleged racist abuse suffered by Arouna Koné and Steven Pienaar after Everton opened the scoring at Brunton Park. Cumbria police are investigating a reported incident and the Everton manager believes Carlisle deserve credit for their swift response. He said: “It shocked everyone but I think the way it was dealt with was perfect, from the referee [Lee Mason] to the way that Carlisle United made clear it wasn’t acceptable [through an immediate announcement on the PA system]. The worry was that the game was going to become 90 minutes of abuse but it was dealt with in the right manner and even the fans in that area stopped it from happening. Arouna and Steven were quite happy at the end of the game with how it was handled.”

Mats Hummels may no longer be international flavour of the month – it’s been noticeably ages since any “good friend” of his has told reporters that he dreams of playing for Chelsea/Arsenal/Manchester United/Barcelona – but his place in German football history looks more assured by the minute. You will remember that in 2014, the perennially unsweaty dandy of Borussia Dortmund’s defence became the catalyst for the introduction of goalline technology in Fußball, when his headed goal was wrongly chalked off in the DFB Pokal final against Bayern Munich. And now, following on from BVB’s tumultuous 2-0 win over Ingolstadt on Saturday, Hummels’ devilishly handsome visage – man-crushes on footballers are permitted, Mrs Bundesliga blog assures me – could well be the involuntary face of technological progress yet again. The 27-year-old was involved in two of three controversial refereeing decisions that all went against the hard-done-by visitors, elicited sympathy from the beneficiaries at the Signal Iduna Park and instantly fired up the debate about widening the use of video evidence for all goals or goalscoring opportunities. The genie, one cannot help but feel, is very much out of the bottle. The bad day for Ralph Hasenhüttl and his men had started in the 29th minute. Dario Lezcano, the Ingolstadt striker, was through clear on Borussia’s goal when Hummels challenged him. Referee Guido Winkmann waved play on. No penalty, no red card, no upset on the cards. Just after the hour mark, Hummels scored a fine goal, with a typically elegant 22-yard chip over the keeper. The fact that the keeper in question was BVB stopper Roman Bürki diminished the accomplishment somewhat, but Winkmann was once again on hand to spoil it for the newly promoted Bavarians. He awarded a free-kick to Dortmund; Lezcano was adjudged to have kicked Hummels just before his overhit-backpass-cum-own-goal. “We were lucky but I wouldn’t call these decisions refereeing mistakes,” said Dortmund boss Thomas Tuchel. “If they’d gone the other way though, we couldn’t have complained.” Hummels, too, admitted that he’d gotten away with the penalty (“It was a foul, unfortunately”) but insisted that he had himself been fouled later on: “I would have played it back on the ground if he hadn’t hit me in the calf.” Marvin Matip was left to lament, cynically: “Maybe Mats Hummels is not allowed to score an own goal.” There were no disagreements about the third and most unnerving incident, however. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s header for the opening goal 12 minutes before the end, the de facto game decider, should not have stood. The Gabon international had strayed offside before Lukasz Piszczek’s cross. That hadn’t been easy to spot but the whole stadium, including the irate Ingolstadt team and Winkmann, staring sheepishly into the middle distance, got to see the replay on the two big video screens. Cue pandemonium and righteous anger from Die Schanzer (Ingolstadt are nicknamed after the city fortress). “I can’t believe they are so stupid to show that goal,” said Matip. “The referee should have punished them for that by taking it away from them.” Sticky scenes are not supposed to be replayed in the Bundesliga grounds but, just like Winkmann and his assistants, the video technician had missed Aubameyang’s offside position. Winkmann was immediately aware of his mistake but told the players there was nothing he could do about it – to rule out the goal would have effectively made use of video evidence, contrary to regulations. “If we had had a referee even half as courageous as my players were today, we wouldn’t have lost this game,” said Hasenhüttl. “My players are in the changing room and can’t believe what’s happened here.” One wonders whether Winkmann couldn’t have found a more elegant solution to that problem, after a little chat with the fourth official, for example, as the Fifa officials did when it came to sending off Zinedine Zidane at the 2006 World Cup final. But this being Germany, a land where even thinly disguised attempts to, ahem, curry favour with Fifa executive committee members before World Cup votes get carefully documented and filed in a ring binder, Winkmann must have felt that he had no choice than to play it by the rule book. Which raises the question whether the rules still make sense when thousands of viewers inside and outside the ground, managers and even players and officials can see the evidence but the referee must put the blinkers on. “It’s grotesque,” felt Kicker magazine. “The referee is rendered a hapless fool, playing blind man’s buff,” wrote Süddeutsche Zeitung. Tuchel agreed. “It’s impossible that every guy with a smart phone knows what’s going on but the referee doesn’t,” he said. “I’m a huge fan of checking every goal [with video evidence].” Hummels, too, concurred. “It would be important to have only correct goals being awarded, I get the sense that 10 to 15% of them should have gone the other way,” he said. “I’ve been a supporter of video evidence for a long time and I won’t change my mind.” For Ingolstadt, he added, it must have been “doubly and triply painful” to witness the refereeing mistake being replayed in the ground. Fifa and the International Football Association Board, which presides over law changes, may see things differently but it can surely be only a matter of time before technology will at least help decide all objectively verifiable matters such as offside and the ball being in/out of play. Maybe it’ll take a ball coming off Hummels’ unsettlingly telegenic brow from an offside position – did we mention that he’s really good looking? – against Bayern (or vice versa) to get the German FA to make the case for extended video surveillance more vigorously. Talking points • Deadline day, despite Sky Deutschland’s best and yellowest effort, was even duller than usual in Germany. Bayern Munich getting former Germany international centre-back Serdar Tasci on loan from Spartak Moscow– in technical director Michael Reschke they increasingly trust at Säbener Strasse – was the sole biggish high-profile last-minute deal, while some light relief from the tedium was at least provided by Hamburger SV, the Bundesliga’s traditional purveyors of assorted mishaps. Their transfer of midfielder Sekou Sanogo fell flat because an email sent by Young Boys Bern from Wankdorfstadion hadn’t gone through in time. Perhaps a problem with an over-sensitive firewall? • Elsewhere, VfB Stuttgart (2-1 over HSV) and Werder Bremen, who battled back from 3-1 down to get a point against Hertha with two goals from Claudio Pizarro, continued their promising start to the Rückrunde. BSC player Änis Ben-Hatira, an unused sub at the Weserstadion, however, was forced to trade the challenge for the Champions League with the relegation fight, as he was hastily moved on to Eintracht Frankfurt on Monday. The 27-year-old had rowed with Mitchell Weiser on the team bus and was told to pack his bag as a result, Hertha confirmed on Tuesday. “Fairness, decency, respect and team spirit are part of our most important principles at the club,” read an official statement. • Indecency, in a very real sense, also put paid to Nick Proschwitz’s future at Bundesliga 2 side SC Paderborn. The 29-year-old had his contract rescinded after drunkenly exposing his backside and front bits at a hotel party during Paderborn’s winter training camp in Turkey. Unfortunately for him, “the stupid boys’ prank” as he called it, was also witnessed by a female employee of the organising agency. She came out to forcibly deny headlines that spoke of “sexual harassment” by Proschwitz – “I wasn’t being harassed at any time, I’m only being harassed by the way this has been reported” – but the former Hull City and Brentford pro was nevertheless shown the door. He will now have to pitch his tent at Sint-Truiden in Belgium. Results: Stuttgart 2-1 HSV, Dortmund 2-0 Ingolstadt, Mainz 1-0 Gladbach, Leverkusen 3-0 Hannover, Augsburg 0-0 Eintracht Frankfurt, Werder 3-3 Hertha, Darmstadt 0-2 Schalke, Wolfsburg 1-1 Köln, Bayern 2-0 Hoffenheim.

It is often reported that the World Cup dents productivity, either by distracting people from their work or by causing them to be so tired or hungover the next day that they don't turn up to do any. In truth, this is probably overestimated. For instance, it is difficult to know whether people work harder before and after a match in order to make up lost time. There's an incentive to overestimate the effect too – because companies love using spurious research about the World Cup to get themselves talked about. (The productivity of the PR industry rockets every fourth summer, I am sure.) Many other World Cup side-effects, however, do seem to be real. We use a lot more electricity This is not an urban myth. The National Grid really is put under more strain following England's World Cup matches than at any other time. Indeed, the largest sudden spike in electricity consumption ever recorded in the UK – 2,800 megawatts – came immediately after Chris Waddle's penalty sailed over the West German goal in 1990s semi-final. The effect is caused by millions of people doing nothing besides watching TV, and then at the same time suddenly returning to their electrical appliances. Kettles are usually said to be the main culprit, as the nation consoles itself in a collective cup of tea, and this seems a good guess as kettles do use a lot of electricity. Even so, it would have taken 1.1m kettles to produce the surge in 1990. This year, the National Grid estimates that the largest foreseeable spike will come at about 8.50pm this evening – half-time during England v Uruguay. It should be only around 1,300 megawatts, which is approximately one large gas-fired power station going at full blast. We get more violent – even if we win Football lovers don't only drink tea. Alcohol consumption also rises during the big matches of a World Cup, and violence rises with it. That seems to be the most likely explanation for the fact that police callouts to incidents of domestic violence rise by more than a third after England lose a match, but also rise more than a quarter after they win. Being in a bad mood, in short, is not all of the problem. Last time, in 2010, 15 British hospitals recorded an average rise of 37.5% in A&amp;E admissions due to assault during the World Cup. Alcohol-related arrests in central Manchester in June have consistently been higher during even-numbered years, when there's a World Cup or European Championship. This may be a distinctly British problem. In Uruguay, a recent study found that property crime falls when the national team is playing – perhaps because everyone is simply too busy watching. Indeed, this year police around the UK have taken the correlation seriously enough to warn known violent offenders before the tournament, and to assemble special callout teams for matchdays. We have more heart attacks – especially if it's a good game Do important football matches trigger heart attacks? That may depend on how the game goes. On the day that France won the World Cup in 1998, the rate of heart attacks in that country fell sharply. A few days earlier, however, when England lost to Argentina on penalties, admissions for acute myocardial infarction at English hospitals rose 25% compared to normal, and continued for the following two days. That said, quite a bit of other research suggests that exciting matches generally can be dangerous – and England v Argentina was certainly a more exciting match than the 1998 final. In Switzerland in 2002, the rate of heart attacks rose 60% overall during the tournament. Perhaps most tellingly, the proportion of men suffering from them rose too. And in 2006, German researchers claimed to find such a strong and clear effect during big matches that they considered them a health risk. "Viewing a stressful soccer match more than doubles the risk of an acute cardiovascular event," the study concluded. "In view of this excess risk, particularly in men with known coronary heart disease, preventive measures are urgently needed." In short: if you have a heart condition, support San Marino. The stock markets might tumble If you have money in the London Stock Exchange, you might want to put it into gold, ideally now. Because research by Alex Edmans, a professor of finance at the London Business School, suggests that markets suffer little crashes the day after their national team is knocked out of a major football tournament. "I investigated the link between 1,100 international football matches and stock returns in 39 countries," Edmans writes. "Being eliminated from the World Cup leads to the national market falling by 0.5% on the next day – controlling for everything else that might drive stock returns. Applied to the UK stock market, this translates into £10bn wiped off the market in a single day." The effect that Edmans noticed is more pronounced with World Cup eliminations than those in European Championships, and in knockout games more than in the group stage. About half of the value lost comes back shortly afterwards, but the rest is lost for ever. Nor is there any noticeable gain when the team wins. That said, you might get lucky if traders can't be bothered to push your own stocks downwards. Other research suggests a fall in trading volumes around the world during a World Cup, as the markets' attention simply drifts elsewhere. We have more babies in nine months' time We don't really need the help of statisticians to prove that people are more likely to start a pregnancy when they are in the right kind of mood – cheerful, optimistic, maybe a little drunk. Legend has it that small baby booms rippled through England nine months after the 1966 and 1970 World Cups, and they are often reported in other countries too. Germany is said to have experienced a 10-15% spike in births as a result of hosting the World Cup during the hot summer of 2006. Last year, some jovial research in the British Medical Journal also suggested that the legend may have some substance to it. For a long time it had been rumoured that Andrés Iniesta's goal for Barcelona in the 2009 Champions League semi-finals had caused a 45% baby boom in Catalonia. That is probably an exaggeration, but the research did find a statistically significant rise of 16% at two Catalan medical centres nine months after the match. "The heightened euphoria following a victory can cultivate hedonic sensations that result in intimate celebrations," the paper explained, not quite with a straight face. If England do well in Brazil, therefore, we might experience a small boom next spring. Or, to put it another way, we won't.

Conforming to national stereotypes South Korea South Korea lost twice, drew once and went home in disgrace. Sound familiar? The reaction of fans to their underperforming team – who finished bottom of their group in Brazil – was to toss toffees at them, which, according to the BBC, "is considered an insult in their country". In fact, the gesture was a little more pointed: the crowds were throwing yeot, cylindrical candies that, to some eyes, resemble penises. What they wanted the players to do with the toffees was left unsaid. Japan Japanese supporters could easily have been excused for being annoyed after their team surrendered a 1-0 lead to then go on and lose 2-1 to Ivory Coast. But instead of ransacking Recife's Arena Pernambuco, as some other supporters may possibly have done, dozens of the Japanese fans stayed behind after the game to go around the stands and fill dozens of bin bags with collected rubbish. This, apparently, is a tradition in Japan, both home and away. England fans take note. Heroes, villains and tributes The super-villain Kurt Vonnegut believed there was no such thing as a villain, but he died before Uruguay's Luis Suárez came to prominence. At the 2010 World Cup, Suárez made himself an enemy of a continent: depriving Africa of its first semi-finalist with a handball against Ghana. This time, he tried to outrage the entire planet. He succeeded, with the exception of Uruguay, whose 4 million citizens were mostly fine with what he did to Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini. Welcome to Tim Howard airport In the US, if 100,000 people sign an online petition, the administration is obliged to respond. After goalkeeper Tim Howard's "human wall" impersonation against Belgium – where he made an astonishing 16 saves – a petition to rename Washington DC's Ronald Reagan airport after the stopper was started. The president had already phoned to congratulate Howard. "I don't know how you are going to survive the mobs when you come back, man," said Obama. "You're gonna have to shave your beard so they don't know who you are." Anthems From the first match, where the Brazilian players and fans kept singing a cappella after the music stopped – as David Luiz wailed and thumped his chest – national anthems have been a stirring and evocative part of this World Cup. Before the tournament, Roy Hodgson announced that he was determined that his England team should sing God Save the Queen and, like truculent schoolchildren, they did as they were told. Switzerland, meanwhile, was so disappointed by the team's rendition of the Swiss Psalm that a public competition has now been launched to come up with a modern, less solemn alternative – and one that is less fixated on the national weather. Celeb curses Mick Jagger The frontman of the Rolling Stones is fast becoming the supporter you least want in your corner. At the 2010 tournament, he was implicated in defeats for the US, England and Brazil. This time, he predicted long World Cup runs for Portugal, England and Italy (all teams that failed to make it through the group stages). But the rock star didn't attend any matches until Brazil's semi-final against Germany: Lucas, his 15-year-old son, was wearing a Brazil shirt. Local fans described him as pe frio – literally cold feet, a Brazilian term for an unlucky omen – and one was concerned enough to superimpose his head on a German uniform. Turns out they were right. Justin Bieber First Bieber was pictured holding a Spanish football shirt. Then he stood on a balcony waving a Brazilian flag. The cult US analysts Men in Blazers commented: "He destroys EMPIRES." Rihanna's tweets Who'd have expected some of the most perceptive commentary to come, via Twitter, from singer Rihanna. On Colombia's stars: "Cuadrado and Rodriguez. Murdaaahhh!!!!" And watching Roy Hodgson's men lose to Uruguay: "ENGLAND whatchu gon do??!" Everyone's new favourite manager The celebrations of Miguel Herrera, Mexico's coach, as his team beat Croatia made him an instant cult hero. When the second goal went in, he sprinted along the sideline, bear-hugged a substitute, before rolling around in a steamy clinch with player Paul Aguilar. "That is one of the happiest days of my life," said Herrera, the lowest-paid boss of all the 32 teams at the tournament. There is now an online campaign for him to replace Roy Hodgson (miguelherreraforengland.com). Van Gaal v Mourinho New Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho go way back: the Chelsea manager was Van Gaal's assistant at Barcelona in the 1990s. In January, Van Gaal said: "Now, he is better than me." Don't believe a word of it. Van Gaal's steering of Holland to the semi-finals indicates he is one of the few managers capable of standing up to Mourinho. Their first encounter is on 25 October at Old Trafford. A new World Cup community The early departure of England deprived many fans of the great communal experiences that have characterised previous World Cups. Evidence suggests that we replaced these moments by watching the games with our phones. Brazil's 7-1 mullering of Germany was the most tweeted event in sporting history, with 35.6m messages sent during the match. The pick? Perhaps this from SundayChants: "Most embarrassing semi since I went to see Brokeback Mountain with my dad." The late, late shows … So far, a nerve-jangling seven of the knockout matches have gone to extra time, and four have been resolved in penalty shootouts. Germany-Algeria saw two goals scored after the 120th minute, while Holland drew level with Mexico in the 88th minute and then won with a penalty in the fourth minute of extra time. Never has there been a tournament where it's been so risky to turn in early. Best tattoo In extra time against Brazil, Chile striker Mauricio Pinilla cracked a shot against the bar in the last minute of extra time. It didn't go in, the game went to penalties, Pinilla missed and Chile lost. You'd think he might have wanted to forget this unfortunate sequence of events, but his response was to recreate the scene on his lower back with the inscription, "One centimetre from glory" written in English. On his temple, he simply inked the word: "Blessed". Goals Just purely on goals, this tournament is set to have been the scoriest World Cup ever. After the third-place play-off there had been 170 in total; and if the final provides just two more goals – which is not a big ask – it will surpass the previous World Cup record, set in 1998, with an average of 2.7 goals per game.

When David Beckham says he intends to take on one more challenge before hanging up his boots, we had better take him seriously. Since Sir Alex Ferguson ended his dream of staying at Old Trafford for the whole of his playing career, Beckham has handled his moves across the football chessboard with considerable shrewdness and few missteps. One day he will probably take up the option he negotiated on his arrival in the United States, the one offering him the chance to head up a newly-formed Major League Soccer club (known as an expansion team). Or he might return to LA Galaxy as an investor. Before that, however, there is still business to be done, and the last dregs of pleasure to be squeezed out of playing on the pitch. Along with underestimating his talent for kicking a ball and influencing the course of a match, the mistake many people make about Beckham is to assume that somehow almost anything in his life takes precedence over the actual game. But look at his record: here is a man who made his first-team debut at 17 and is still competing for a national title at 37. On the way he has played with distinction for Manchester United, Real Madrid, Milan and LA Galaxy, for whom he will play a final match on 1 December, in an attempt to retain the MLS Cup. His six years at the Home Depot Centre, where he will make his farewell appearance, have been a time of steady growth for a league that came into being at the time of the 1994 World Cup but endured difficult times until his arrival, with weaker teams going to the wall on a regular basis. If life in Lotus Land has been good to him and his family, then he has been good for Major League Soccer. It is still no threat to the national popularity of baseball, basketball or college and pro football, but it has carved out a solid niche, and he has been its figurehead of its journey to stability. True, there are some Galaxy fans who resent the two winters he spent on loan in Milan while trying to maintain his fitness in order to keep playing for England. Elsewhere, however, the supporters of his various clubs have nothing but praise for his contribution and commitment. In Madrid he won over a deeply sceptical Fabio Capello and helped secure a league title at the end of a difficult season. A couple of years later he did well enough at Milan, where he played under Carlo Ancelotti and Leonardo, for the club to try to hang on to him after his loan period came to an end. He was also able to avail himself there of the expertise from the team of physiologists that had prolonged the active life of such players as Paolo Maldini, Pippo Inzaghi and Clarence Seedorf. If Beckham has been a shade manipulative, plotting his way through football to his maximum advantage, then perhaps we can blame Ferguson, who gave him a brutal demonstration that loyalty means nothing. Unable, in his old-school way, to see the substance beneath the flashy trappings, the United manager not only discarded Beckham but ensured that the club made a vast profit from a player who had cost them nothing and had given them so much. That, if nothing else, taught Beckham how football works. There will be plenty of offers for his services in his final season. Some of them will probably come from England, with Queens Park Rangers potentially to the fore, especially if Harry Redknapp – who welcomed him to the training facilities at Tottenham Hotspur – takes over from Mark Hughes. Given Beckham's inherent and essentially unpretentious love of football, the modest environment of Loftus Road might not prove a deterrent to the acceptance of Tony Fernandes's money. But what sort of a challenge would that represent to a man who has already proved himself in four countries? Our last chance of seeing him in England probably vanished with his omission from Britain's Olympic football team, a decision that, after all his work on behalf of the 2012 bid, he swallowed with no public display of disappointment, leaving the rest of us to conclude that Stuart Pearce's threadbare team could only have been improved by his presence. To Beckham, a new challenge is more likely to involve another venture into terra incognita, with Australia and China among the favourites. His family's needs will also be taken into consideration. Like her husband, Victoria Beckham has overcome scepticism to build a free-standing career. Her fashion business is an international success, and somewhere like Shanghai, where Didier Drogba and Nicolas Anelka play for one of the city's two Chinese Super League teams amid the fast-proliferating neon skyscrapers, might be appealing. Paris Saint-Germain, where Ancelotti is making use of the Qatar Investment Fund's resources and Mrs Beckham would no doubt enjoy seeing her clothes in the boutiques of the Faubourg Saint-Honore, is another possibility, although it is hard to see her husband making much of an inroad into a side with Champions League pretensions. All in all, as the rumours have been saying, Australia's A League looks the best bet: Sydney FC if he and his family want the bustle and glamour of another great international city, Melbourne Heart if he fancies a slightly more laid-back life by the bay in St Kilda, Adelaide United if he likes the idea of watching cricket at one of the world's loveliest grounds, Newcastle Jets if he's interested in a reunion with his former England colleague Emile Heskey, and Perth Glory, amid the mineral-rich remoteness of Western Australia, if money is the principal lure. Whatever he decides, it will probably involve an element of risk as well as guaranteed reward. There was no shortage of scoffing when he announced that he was taking off for Southern California, but he made it work. He usually does.

The England Under-21s' victory over Serbia that secured their place at Euro 2013 was overshadowed by violent scenes at the end of the match, with Danny Rose the target of racist abuse from the crowd and the home players kicking out at his team-mates and Steve Wigley, the assistant manager. Connor Wickham's 90th-minute goal in Krusevac was followed by missiles being aimed at players celebrating the strike, which ensured England progressed 2-0 on aggregate, having won the home leg 1-0. Rose, the left-back, was subsequently shown a red card, though the reason for it was unclear, and he then gave a sarcastic thumbs up to the crowd and mimicked monkey gestures. His manager, Stuart Pearce, confirmed Rose had been racially abused. A statement from the Football Association read: "The FA condemns both the scenes of racism and the confrontation at the final whistle during which time our players and staff were under extreme provocation. The FA has reported a number of incidents of racism to Uefa following the fixture. These were seemingly aimed at a number of England black players by the crowd. The matter is now with Uefa." Pearce told ESPN: "I think there were one or two racist incidents that came from the crowd and they have been reported to Uefa by ourselves. It is in their hands now; they will have to deal with that." After Jack Butland, the England goalkeeper, tried to lead his team-mates off the pitch, Wigley was attacked as he tried to follow down the tunnel. The goalkeeping coach, Martin Thomas, appeared to be headbutted. Pearce told BBC 5 Live: "Punches headbutts, god knows what, were thrown at the end." The Liverpool midfielder Jordan Henderson said: "There was a lot of racist abuse out there from the stands and a lot going on after the game. There were also stones, coins and seats getting thrown at us. What happened wasn't nice and is not called for in football." There were also reports of intimidation of England Under-21 players by a member of Serbia's backroom staff in the tunnel immediately before the game. Pearce added: "It is very sad, but we are united as a team and a staff. A lot is happening in our country with regard to stamping out racism and I am very proud of the reaction of our players towards the end. "It is a real shame because, over two ties, it was a really close game – two good teams going hammer and tongs at each other.It is just a shame it was soured in the last few minutes of the second leg of the tie. Savo Milosevic, their technical director, has come to our dressing room and apologised for any behaviour that was unsavoury. I never want to see any football matches end like that; this is a sporting arena." In 2007 Serbia were fined £16,000 by Uefa for racist chanting from fans aimed at the England Under-21 side during a European Championship match there. This latest incident continued a troubled sequence of racist incidents in football that domestically have included the Luis Suárez-Patrice Evra and the Anton Ferdinand-John Terry affairs. Ferdinand, apparently in reaction to the scenes in Serbia, tweeted: "I wonder if Blatter is gonna say they should just shake hands!??", a reference to the claim of Sepp Blatter, the Fifa president, that any inappropriate remarks or gestures during a game could be forgotten if players shook hands. Paul Ince, who was working as a pundit on ESPN and whose son Thomas set up Wickham's goal, called for Serbia to be hit with a 10-year ban from major tournaments. "Sepp Blatter and [Uefa's president, Michel] Platini need to look at this. If it was me they [Serbia] would be kicked out for the next five tournaments – European, World Cups – but they will get a little ban and that will be it. Things like that are not what we want to see in football – it takes it back to the dark ages." He added: "If you are black, it is hard to actually keep control of yourself because you are the one having the racist chants. From looking at what we have seen on TV, they have done very well to keep cool heads. It is a shame because tomorrow we will be talking about something we don't want to talk about. What we should be talking about is England qualifying for Israel in 2013." Pearce has now overseen an unprecedented four consecutive qualifications for European Under-21 championships. "The important thing, when the dust settles, is we are going to a championship because we deserved to over two legs," he said. "Our players have put in a lot of hard effort and sweat to get there. There is a real collectiveness here. We will let the authorities deal with this. "All we know is we have given a good account of ourselves over two matches, we have won nine out of 10 matches in qualification and I am very proud of my team. "I am very proud of my players and my staff and very proud of the achievement in getting to a fourth tournament in a row."

Martin O'Neill offered his unequivocal backing to Danny Graham on Friday, as he prepared to thrust the £5m signing straight into the squad. Graham, a childhood Newcastle fan, has made some less than complimentary statements about Sunderland in the past but O'Neill said: "I have really no doubts that he will score goals and he will prove a great buy." Reading invested in a new forward of their own recently and now Brian McDermott must decide whether to opt for Nick Blackman or give recent super-sub Adam Le Fondre a start.

The returning Paul Scharner is likely to go straight into the Wigan starting lineup as Roberto Martínez's injury problems in defence show little sign of abating. With Arouna Koné at the Africa Cup of Nations and Mauro Boselli out on another loan spell, the home side look short of cover in attack as well. Southampton, with two defeats in their past seven Premier League away matches – at Anfield and Old Trafford, both times by a single goal – can be expected to push Wigan's already stretched resources to the limit.

1) Title beckons for relentless United "We have a winning mentality," said Patrice Evra. "This is the Manchester United spirit, the strength of the boss. It is what he instils in us every year." All of which pretty much summed up the leaders' victory on the banks of the Thames. United have been more ruthless at times this season, running up cricket scores against cowed opponents, but this was the type of win that suggests the title is en route back to Old Trafford: a tight contest, marked by some fine saves from David de Gea and timely interventions by everyone from Rio Ferdinand to Rafael da Silva, and a winning goal plucked from the ether. Their forward line boasts such depth – far more so than either of the clubs closest to them – that they seem relentless. Indeed, if Manchester City or Chelsea boasted either a Robin van Persie or a Wayne Rooney, or even a Javier Hernández, the competition at the top might be far tighter. As it is, it would take an implosion more spectacular than last season's for United's campaign to end in domestic disappointment. Dominic Fifield 2) Benteke is too good to go down Paul Lambert believes his young players will be better next season. He is surely right but whether they are all in a Villa shirt then depends upon the next three months. Christian Benteke's two-goal performance at Goodison Park showed that he is already a formidable Premier League player. There are few more dominant target men around and, with 18 goals for his clubs and country this season, the Belgian is proving prolific. It is inconceivable he will be playing in the Championship in 12 months' time. Other players Lambert has promoted or unearthed, like Andreas Weimann, Ashley Westwood and Matthew Lowton, could also be targets for top-flight clubs if Villa go down. Richard Jolly 3) Pulis must set his sights higher It is about time Tony Pulis aspired to being more than a mere MOT tester in the luxury showroom of the Premier League. Stoke have now been in the top flight for five seasons and spent plenty of money but their manager's approach to most away matches still boils down to checking whether others' fancy fleets meet minimum requirements. Can opponents run, jump, jostle and scrap? If so, they will win at home to Stoke, who under Pulis have never taken so much as a point from the Emirates, Old Trafford, Stamford Bridge or the Etihad. Of course, the very top clubs have more resources than Stoke but others have proved that does not make them unbeatable. It is not about a style of play but a mindset and since ultra-negativity has not worked, how about committing a tad more to attack to make Stoke roadworthy? Paul Doyle 4) Value is a virtue of La Liga Have you heard of this thing called La Liga? It's a league in Spain and it's got teams like Barcelona and Real Madrid, who have players like Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. You really should check it out. That's what Michael Laudrup did in the summer, when he signed Michu for a staggering £2m from Rayo Vallecano. Michu has since grabbed the headlines with his 16 goals for Swansea but he is not the only bargain Laudrup picked up. He also managed to get Pablo Hernández for £5.5m from Valencia, a cracking Spanish winger who was playing in the Champions League last season. He was wonderful at Upton Park on Saturday, even if Swansea left empty-handed, and it was remarkable to think that Matt Jarvis cost West Ham almost twice as much last summer. Jacob Steinberg 5) Depth charge remains worry for resurgent Royal Reading's revival over the last seven games has been impressive, and in the relatively brief amount of time they have been on the field there have been signs that the transfer window signings, Hope Akpan, Stephen Kelly, Daniel Carrico and Nick Blackman, could be useful acquisitions, the 21-year-old attacking midfielder Akpan in particular. That the Royals failed with bids for Gylfi Sigurdsson and Tom Ince, and also spoke to Yossi Benayoun, indicates where Brian McDermott considers their greatest weakness lies, and it is asking an awful lot of Akpan, a young player whom Everton released and whose only real experience has come with Crawley Town, to consistently provide the creative influence they need. There can be no doubting Reading's spirit, but questions over depth of quality remain. Richard Rae 6) Newcastle's bygone ways ease path to French connections The 22-year-old France midfielder Moussa Sissoko was likened to a young Patrick Vieira during Newcastle's 3-2 home win over Chelsea. Deployed in an attacking midfield role he scored twice, skinned Ashley Cole and terrorised John Terry. Alan Pardew signed Sissoko for a bargain £1.8m from Toulouse last month because there were only six months left on his contract but the real mystery is why the big Manchester and London clubs were not jostling for the signature of an ultra-fast, ultra-powerful, technically accomplished player Chelsea simply could not contain? Newcastle did face some competition for Sissoko, from QPR for instance, but their policy of wining, dining and generally showing excellent hospitality to French contacts has clearly paid dividends. Sometimes the old-fashioned, humanised ways of doing business really are the best. Louise Taylor 7) Striker-less Spurs When asked about his striking dilemma after Tottenham's only recognised striker Jermain Defoe picked up an ankle injury, André Villas-Boas coolly replied "the world champions don't always play with a striker". Grinding out a narrow 1-0 victory at a 10-man West Brom doesn't exactly conjure up Iberian superlatives but in Gareth Bale, Tottenham do have somebody world-class. As at Norwich, Bale played and scored from a more central role behind Clint Dempsey, not so much as a false-nine to link midfield and attack, more as a desperate attempt to get him on the ball as much as possible. Work it did, but Spurs can't expect the Welshman to pull a rabbit out the hat every week, and will hope that Emmanuel Adebayor, who returns to north London following Togo's Sunday night exit, will give them a much-needed focal point this coming weekend against Newcastle. Michael Butler 8) Redknapp joins the ABC club The QPR manager may have lost Loic Rémy to a groin injury, have failed to sign Peter Crouch and Peter Odemwingie on transfer deadline day and can only rely on Bobby Zamora for 20-minute cameos due to the striker's ongoing hip problem, but there is no question of him lamenting the decision to let Djibril Cissé leave on loan to Al-Gharafa in Qatar in January. "No, I had no intention of keeping him. I had to wait for the window to open to get rid of him." Redknapp is clearly a paid-up member of the Anyone But Cissé club. James Callow 9) Yes, City can still do it. But, no, they probably won't After Manchester City's 2-2 draw with Liverpool the question is: can they win the title from nine points back from Manchester United with 13 games remaining? Mathematically the answer is yes, so the more pertinent question is: will they? To which the response is surely no, unless Sir Alex Ferguson's men crumble for a second successive season during the run-in. If United allow this to happen then fans might be advised to empty their half of the city. Last season's final-day Sergio Agüero strike to win a first crown in 44 years might be trumped. Forget noisy neighbours – the glee of the Blues congregation would fill the pubs and workplaces of Manchester in a deafening summer of sound. Jamie Jackson 10) Like dog owners, Saints must learn not to let go of the lead "I'm frustrated about conceding in the last minute, it was a very bad goal to give away," said Southampton's Rickie Lambert after his side's 2-2 draw at Wigan. "When the dust settles and you have time to think about it then we're going to think of it being a good point but right now it doesn't feel like that, it's a bitter pill to swallow." Lambert should not be too hard on himself or his team-mates, though. They have come a long way since facing the same opposition back in August when they were sloppy in possession and bereft of ideas. Back then, and indeed for much of the early part of the season, they looked like relegation fodder but recent performances have shown that they have the necessary fight and talent to stay in the Premier League. But they will need to cut out those sloppy defensive errors that repeatedly rob them off points – they have now conceded 24 points from leading positions this season, more than any other side. Do that and they should be comfortable despite their difficult run-in. Ian McCourt

Gareth Bale struck a superb late equaliser to salvage a point for Tottenham Hotspur from a match in which they struggled for long periods. Norwich had deservedly gone into the break in front thanks to a goal by Wes Hoolahan but Spurs improved in the second period without coming close to scoring until Bale made up for an otherwise ineffective performance with a wonderful goal in the 80th minute. Tottenham's January recruit from Schalke, Lewis Holtby, began on the bench while efforts continued away from the action to capture a new striker. Unless those efforts bear fruit, however, Jermain Defoe will likely have to continue unsupported up front, especially as Togo's progression to the Africa Cup of Nations quarter-final just before kick-off means André Villas-Boas will be without Emmanuel Adebayor for at least two more matches. Defoe has been bothered by pelvic trouble for the past month and was omitted from Sunday's FA Cup defeat at Leeds United in the hope that rest would alleviate the problem. He was full of zest early on at Norwich, charging down an attempted clearance by Norwich goalkeeper Mark Bunn in the first minute. It quickly transpired that the home players were far sharper than visitors. Seemingly unperturbed by a six-match streak without a win in the Premier League and humiliation in the FA Cup at the hands of Luton Town, Norwich dominated the first period. Like Tottenham, Norwich are seeking new strikers but Grant Holt seemed determined to show they do not need Luciano Becchio of Leeds or Celtic's Gary Hooper. He squandered his first chance to prove his point when he thrashed a 20-yard shot over the bar in the 20th minute but continued to trouble Tottenham and could have been given a penalty when a burst into the box four minutes later led to him going down under a challenge from Jan Vertonghen. He eventually forced Hugo Lloris into a save on the half-hour mark, outjumping Vertonghen to aim a downward header at goal from seven yards. Two minutes later Norwich got their reward for the bright start, as Snodgrass raced down the right and sent a cross to the far side of the box. Anthony Pilkington fired it back into the centre for Wes Hoolahan to sweep into the net. At every stage in the move that led to the goal Norwich had been quicker to the ball. That was symptomatic of Spurs' sluggishness and Norwich were not going to make it easy for them to get back into the game. Former Tottenham centre-back Sébastien Bassong ran the length of the pitch in the 38th minute in an attempt to do more damage but fractionally failed to connect with Ryan Bennet's cross. Gareth Bale and Aaron Leeon were barely visible but in the 41st minute the latter did materialise and thread a pass through to Defoe, whose 18-yard shot brought Bunn's firsts save. Bale swapped positions with Clint Dempsey for the second half, playing just off Defoe in the hope of getting more involved and in the 51st minute he at last made an impact, bringing a decent save from Bunn with a 25-yard drive. Spurs' improvement continued and Norwich had to endure bouts of ball-chasing, though Chris Hughton's men retained their threat on the break. Neither side, however, were creating many chances. Holtby was introduced for his debut in the 71st minute and hinted at fine things to come with some elegant touches. Within seven minutes he was booked, however, as he found Norwich's intensity tough to contend with. Spurs needed inspiration – and Bale provided it. He collected the ball inside his half, galloped past opponents and into the Norwich box before poking the ball into the net from 16 yards. Bunn had to repel a long-range shot from Gylfi Sigurdsson two minutes from time to secure the draw.

LORD FERG SPEAKS, HACKS COWER Sir Alex Ferguson is angry, which presents the Fiver with a tricky dilemma: is this news or just business as usual? Today it is both. Tricky dilemma over, although not, it seems, for the rest of the nation's football hacks, who arrived at Carrington this morning to hear Ferguson's weekly lecture and were alarmed to see a hairdryer ominously perched on his desk and pointing their way following reports that Wayne Rooney is to be wedged through the exit door by Manchester United. Naturally much 2+2ing followed, leading to Ferguson revealing that he's put some of the Fiver's Big Paper colleagues on the naughty step until they apologise for the heinous crime of suggesting that Rooney may be sold. "He [Rooney] will be here next year, you have my word on that," Ferguson roared. "There is no issue between myself and Wayne Rooney. To suggest we don't talk is nonsense." Now, the Fiver's idea of a searching question is usually along the lines of "Where is the gents, Mr Ferguson?" and is eager not to get into any trouble for any spurious nonsense, so with that in mind it would like to take this opportunity to congratulate United on winning Big Cup for a fourth time, Ferguson for inventing The Harlem Shake and Rooney for his magnificent hair. There, that should secure a pass for life at Carrington and all the sausage rolls and pork pies a hungry hack could want! Ferguson's denial that Rooney is off to Barcelona/Real Madrid/Manchester City/Paris Saint-Beckham/Shanghai Shenhua has, of course, led to people who just want to Have Their Say having their say, thereby making the world a better place. Because there's quotes, you see, and any journalism expert with a degree in Posting Stuff on Twitter knows that a story can only be true if there's quotes. Because, quotes, end of. Yeah. Nuance be damned. The only problem with adopting that line, of course, is that it's usually best to look under the sauce to see if it's really pasta or a steaming pile of horse manure instead. After all, get a load of this from April 2003, as Ferguson and United denied rumours that David Beckham was going to join Real Madrid in the summer. "It is totally inaccurate to suggest a deal has been done with Real Madrid for David Beckham," said Ferguson, while United added in an official statement: "We can categorically deny that any deal is in place to sell David Beckham to Real Madrid. David will be a Manchester United player next season." But David was not a Manchester United player next season! Ooohh, they got us good, just like they did in 2008 when Ferguson said that he wouldn't sell Real a virus, let alone Cristiano Ronaldo. The Fiver forgets who Ronaldo plays for now. All of which means that by the end of Ferguson's press conference this morning, the Fiver was beginning to question the very existence of this "Wayne Rooney" character and even "Manchester United". What's certain is that Rooney's future remains up for debate, even if he should return for Sunday's FA Cup quarter-final against Chelsea, a match which brings us to the best Ferguson soundbite of all: his incredible refusal to give Rafael Benitez a good kicking. "I'm not going to kick anyone when they're lying down. That's not my style," he smirked, giving his rival a good shoeing while somehow managing to keep a straight face. Farewell, Wayne. QUOTE OF THE DAY AND RECOMMENDED VIEWING "I knew my god Jerome would be there holding the space, with his strength and courage and allowing his light to shine as well.

"I know it probably doesn't count as pedantry, but can I be one of the 1,057 Fiver readers to point out that describing the Coliseum as a 'trendy Luton nightspot' (yesterday's Fiver) is an oxymoron.

"I'm torn between categorising Gareth Bale as foreign (Welsh) because he is a diver and British, as he is currently in good form, but getting ready to knock him next season when he doesn't score crazy amounts of goals because someone tries the novel approach of marking him and Spurs also find a striker.

Bucharest is full of strange contradictions and odd juxtapositions. A city which variously accommodates unremittingly grey Communist-era housing blocks, broad Parisian-style boulevards, and baroque palaces blends brutal ugliness with bling-encrusted elegance. It also seems home to scores of tough looking men wearing dark glasses and black leather jackets. Several appear to hang around at Steaua Bucharest where the owner Gigi Becali could probably swap a few stories with Roman Abramovich about coping with enemies. Chelsea's security-conscious owner is unlikely to attend his team's Europa League first-leg tie at Steaua on Thursday evening. This represents a huge shame as Becali, arguably European football's most controversial figure, had hoped to invite the Russian oligarch to join him in a fashion parade. "Let Abramovich compare his clothes with mine then we can see whose suits are really expensive," declared Becali after Steaua beat Ajax in the last round. Should Chelsea's owner turn up after all, he can look forward to sitting down to dinner with Becali, something the latter was clearly disinclined to do with his Ajax counterpart. "Why would I sit at the Ajax president's table," he declared. "He wears €200 shoes, mine cost €4,000." All in all, February proved quite an eventful month for the 54-year-old businessman and politician, who marked it by being handed a three-year suspended prison sentence for illegally detaining three men in a house on Bucharest's outskirts following a rather dramatic drive in a Mercedes. It was revenge for that trio allegedly having stolen Becali's car in 2009. "How can those judges live with themselves," he lamented. "The sentence violates my human rights. I will not be mocked." Not content with merely being the sort of character who might crop up in a Lee Child thriller, Becali is also capable of making Mario Balotelli look like modesty personified. Becali possesses a painting based on Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper in which he occupies the place of Jesus. Meanwhile, 11 Steaua players and their coach are depicted as the disciples. He was incandescent when the Romanian media reported he had commissioned the artwork, instead insisting it was a present from an admirer anxious to see him portrayed as Jesus. Religion – of an extremely orthodox Christian persuasion – looms large in Becali's life and to the possible annoyance of Laurentiu Reghecampf, the team's latest coach, he was swift to ascribe the win against Ajax to "divine intervention". His fundamentalist views on homosexuality have also alienated fans. Despite unconvincing protestations to the contrary, Becali does not seem to approve and famously banned Steaua's in-house DJ from playing Queen records on account of Freddie Mercury's sexual orientation. Similarly, managers have come to regard the Steaua hot-seat almost as toxic as its Stamford Bridge equivalent during the Abramovich era. A one-time shepherd, Becali has ushered 16 full-time head coaches through the doors during the past decade, some returning more than once to the dugout before being ushered back out. Back in 2007 Gheorghe Hagi, Romania's greatest player, had a brief stint in the hot seat but swiftly departed, apparently severely stressed. In subsequent interviews Hagi spoke of "being tortured second by second" and "humiliated" by the owner's "interference". Reghecampf, appointed last May, might normally have been regarded as approaching the end of his natural shelf-life but the 37-year-old former midfielder, who spent several seasons playing in the Bundesliga before returning to the country of his birth, may yet prove an exception to the rule. With Steaua 12 points clear at the top of Romania's top division, the 1986 European Cup winners look well on course for their first domestic league title in seven years.

Nothing much seems to embarrass Chelsea, on or off the pitch. Even so, the Blues must be quietly relieved they did not waive the clause in Romelu Lukaku's season-long loan contract with West Bromwich Albion that prohibits the Belgian playing against his parent club. On current form, what Lukaku might have done to Chelsea's creaking defence when the two clubs meet at Stamford Bridge next Saturday does not bear thinking about. On the other hand, neither did Chelsea exercise their option to recall the powerful 19-year-old striker during last month's transfer window. To the relief of the Albion manager, Steve Clarke, the London club chose to buy Demba Ba instead, leaving Lukaku to continue scoring the goals which are giving the Baggies a realistic chance of achieving European qualification. "There are 11 games to go and we are so close to Europe you can smell it," said the engaging Lukaku, whose double secured the win which made the Midlanders the first of the mid-table bunch to reach the 40-point benchmark and left them just two points behind sixth-placed Everton. "For me, after playing in Europe with Anderlecht when I was younger, you want to do it again, especially in the Premier League, that's the best thing that can happen to a young man's career. "I'm just having a wonderful year. Everything is going well, I'm working hard in training. They know what I want to do, what I have to improve every day. Every day I come in with a smile on my face." He talks to Chelsea, who paid Anderlecht £18m for him in August 2011, every 10 days or so. "I don't know what they will decide. There are a lot of clever people over there and they are seeing that I am playing in a good way," he said. "I just want to be a part of them. Let me step my game up and take West Brom into Europe." If he does, surely Chelsea would not be daft enough to sanction another long loan for a player who two years ago was being described as a second Didier Drogba. The similarities are there, not least in build and strength, though Lukaku is the first to acknowledge there are areas, notably in the air, where he can get much better. Clarke said: "Rom is very level-headed, he understands where he wants to go in the game, what he wants to be, how good he wants to be, and he's prepared to work hard at that. For me as a coach, that's refreshing. "Hopefully, he is improving all the time because we said to him when he came here we would help him to do that, we would give him more minutes on the pitch than he got in his first season at Chelsea. He said he would come in and try and help the Albion this season and we've both been true to our word. It's been a good partnership." That the force is with Lukaku was evident in both his goals. The first, a penalty given after Craig Gardner handled a Liam Ridgwell cross, infuriated Sunderland because their own appeal when Gareth McAuley blocked an Adam Johnson shot was turned down. The second was a triumph of hope and persistence, Lukaku closing down Titus Bramble's under-hit backpass and seeing Simon Mignolet's attempted clearance rebound off a shin and back into the goal. Stéphane Sessègnon pulled a goal back with a cleverly placed shot and, as the frustrated Sunderland manager Martin O'Neill pointed out, the visitors had a number of chances to equalise in a match from which they deserved at least a point. "It's been the same story in the last three games. Unfortunately by Tuesday the performance will be forgotten and it is down as a result, and we need to win some matches, we know that," said O'Neill. "I am concerned. Any side in the bottom half is looking over their shoulders until you get the required number of points." Man of the match Romelu Lukaku (West Bromwich Albion)

Lionel Messi has been included in the Barcelona squad to face Paris Saint-Germain but he faces a wait to find out if he will start at Camp Nou. A final decision is not expected until Wednesday morning following the hamstring injury he picked up in last week's first leg. Meanwhile, David Beckham was given hope that, in the absence of Blaise Matuidi, he will be included. The PSG manager, Carlo Ancelotti, defended the former England captain despite criticism after the first leg, insisting: "He has a good chance of playing." Their Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic told CNN: "I think he has been very important for us. In the situation that we are in now, the club has been changing from a normal club to a top club, and Beckham gives you some kind of confidence. He has the responsibility, on the pitch and off the pitch, to lead the way for these two months, which is very important. He has a quality, a big quality; he has a touch that I haven't seen many players have. And he is very elegant when he plays." Barcelona's coach, Tito Vilanova, is again expected to be in the dugout as he was last Tuesday, having returned from two months of cancer treatment in the United States. However, it was his assistant, Jordi Roura, who faced the media on the eve of this quarter-final second leg and by the time the press conference ended Roura could have been forgiven for having lost patience. The first question was about Messi and so was the last. In between, he was mostly asked about Messi. Just as Andrés Iniesta, Maxwell and Ancelotti were. Iniesta admitted that Barcelona are "Messi-dependent." Even in his absence, the Argentinian was present. The good news was that he was subsequently present in Barcelona's squad but with a 2-2 draw from the first leg he could begin on the bench, to be called upon if needed. When the official list was released, Messi's name, like that of Adriano and Pedro, was followed by an asterisk, denoting a player who had not yet been given the all-clear by medical staff. His likely replacement in the false No9 role is Cesc Fábregas, who played there against Mallorca on Saturday and scored the first hat-trick of his career. When Roura was asked about Messi for the last time, he replied: "I imagine he is preparing to go out there now. They'll be looking at him, seeing how he is." Minutes later, Messi strolled into the sunlight at Sant Joan Despí along with the rest of his team-mates and took part in a training session with them – at least for the quarter of an hour that was open to the media. Messi was taken off at half-time in Paris. He had taken a shot from the edge of the area and then reached for his hamstring. Tests ruled out a tear, a formal statement citing only a "muscle injury" and making no mention of the second leg. "I'll be back soon. Luckily, it wasn't serious," he wrote on his Facebook page. Only eight days later, it may yet be too soon. "We'll wait a bit," Roura said. "The sensations are good but in the end we'll have to wait until after the session, to see how he is, to see what's happening, and then we'll make a decision. If players play it is because there are guarantees [that they will be fine] but we'll wait to see his progress. We still have today's session and tomorrow's. When the best player in the world is not there of course it is a handicap but, that said, there are lots of players who have played very well lots of times." Messi has scored 43 league goals this season with Barcelona's next highest, Fábregas, on nine. He also has eight assists, a figure that only three players in Spain can better. Ancelotti insisted that PSG's approach will not be determined by Messi's availability, which is probably more than can be said for Barcelona. "Without doubt there is Messi-dependence in the sense that he is fundamental for us," said Iniesta. "But there is not Messi-dependence in the sense that this is a team game and we have very good players who can perform well. Cesc is a complete player who understands the game: he combines well with others, he interprets the play and he moves intelligently. He was away for a long time [at Arsenal]. We're lucky that he is back here now." "But," Iniesta added, "of course Messi is fundamental, irreplaceable, because of what he represents and what he does. He is the No1 when he plays. But if you can't play, you can't play. If he does, it is because they are sure and I am convinced that whatever decision they take will be the right one. It will be an intense match, the pace will be incredibly high and it will be demanding. I hope Leo can play and the same goes for Adriano and Pedro. It will depend on what the doctors think, what Messi thinks and what the coaches think." There was criticism for Beckham after the first leg, in which he started and played 69 minutes, with L'Equipe giving him a match rating of only three out of 10. But Ancelotti urged him not to take any notice. "Some people criticised David, some people were happy with him," he said. "I was happy, so Beckham has to be happy. I don't know if he will play tomorrow. When the manager is happy [with a player] he has a lot of chances to play."

Injury, and as the Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger pointed out afterwards, competition for places meant Tomas Rosicky was starting only his second Premier League game of the season on Saturday. But on this form it is hard to imagine anyone, even the likes of Jack Wilshere – along with Theo Walcott, expected to be fit and available for the Gunners' fixture at home to Norwich next Saturday – displacing the little Czech in the Arsenal midfield. "He's such an important player who turns the game forward, brings movement into the game, makes the game look simple and always you feel when he has the ball that something can happen, and not many players have that in the locker," Wenger said. The two goals, one a stooping header from Gervinho's clever little cross after 20 minutes, the second neatly finished after the West Bromwich Albion goalkeeper Ben Foster could only parry his fierce initial volley shortly after the break, were only one aspect of Rosicky's excellence. For the best part of an hour he was the game's dominant influence by some margin, and if his first contribution was defensive, heading Claudio Yacob's header off his own line, thereafter he was relentlessly creative. Only when the Albion manager, Steve Clarke, having begun with Shane Long as a lone striker in front of a five-man midfield, brought on two more forwards in Romelu Lukaku, his top scorer, and Markus Rosenberg and switched to a 4-3-3 did the game change. Per Mertesacker was sent off for chopping down Long – it was so obvious even Wenger saw it and had no arguments – and after James Morrison had converted the penalty, Rosicky and his nine remaining team-mates were fully occupied in desperately defending to secure the three points that lifted them into fourth. Six wins in seven league games is form second only to that of the champions-elect Manchester United and, said Rosicky, the best way of answering some of the criticism that has been aimed at Arsenal this season. "It's difficult when you're not playing, you want to be part of the team and the only way you can get into the team is through hard work," he said. "You have to convince the manager that you're part of the team, that's what I am trying to do and it's what I will continue to do." Asked whether, like his assistant Steve Bould, he believes Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea's continued involvement in European football could give Arsenal an advantage during the run-in, Wenger gave a verbal shrug. "Well, ideally I would like to be in the Champions League as well, you know, but if you are on a good run, maybe it can be a little advantage because you can recover more." The defender Jonas Olsson said Albion's performance had demonstrated their collective determination not to allow what has been an excellent season to peter out in disappointing fashion. "We showed we still want to win games," the Swede said. "You could see everyone was fighting, everyone was trying for 95-96 minutes to try and get something out of it. "We want to stay top six, seven, eight. It's important to see the club going in the right direction and progressing every year, we've done so for the last three or four years and it makes it easier to attract players. "We have to keep with the model we have been doing, strengthening the team every season, keeping the players we have. That is the key element that has made us come this far, that we have kept the squad intact, but every year sharpens the competition." Man of the match Tomas Rosicky (Arsenal)

Nigel Adkins will not discuss relegation but his Reading players know where they are heading after losing seven Premier League matches in succession for the second time this season. Bottom of the table and eight points adrift of safety with only six games left, they are staring into the abyss, and if Adkins will not speak the "R" word his principal goalscorer is prepared to face up to reality. After Saturday's demoralising 2-0 defeat by Southampton Adam Le Fondre said: "The new gaffer has been running the rule over all the players, and if we do get relegated there will have to be a comeback and promotion push next season, so it's time to impress and make sure he wants to keep you." Substitute the word when for if and the 12-goal striker is spot on. Reading's disintegration after a bright start was clearly the product of brittle morale and Adkins does not have the time to put everything right. He was appointed for his success at getting teams promoted and the work on which he will be judged starts next season. He badly wanted to beat Southampton, who sacked him in January but, as the perspicacious Mick Jagger observed, you can't always get what you want, and the Saints go marching on, with three consecutive victories and 10 points from their last four games. The proliferation of foreign managers is a worrying trend and the appointment of the unsung and out of work Mauricio Pochettino raised a few eyebrows, but the Argentinian, who was sacked by Espanyol in November, has made an encouraging start, with wins against Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea already to his credit. Saturday's success was not without controversy. Reading claimed Jay Rodriguez had fouled their goalkeeper, Adam Federici, in scoring the first goal, that a header from Le Fondre had crossed the line and that they should have had a penalty when Hal Robson-Kanu went down under Jos Hooiveld's challenge. A less partisan view was that Federici should have been braver in contesting possession with Rodriguez, that there was sufficient doubt about Le Fondre's attempt to prevent the officials awarding a goal and that Hooiveld had made legitimate contact with the ball. In reality, Reading had only themselves to blame for their continuing decline. They should have scored first but Sean Morrison and Le Fondre wasted inviting opportunities, allowing Southampton to settle and pass their way into the ascendancy. Delightful triangular movement saw the excellent Rodriguez give them the lead in the 35th minute and the same player then struck the crossbar. Before half-time he was back again, his shot parried by Federici and Gaston Ramírez blasting the loose ball wide of the gaping net. Rodriguez set up the second goal for Adam Lallana and Steven Davis and Guly Do Prado might have doubled the margin. Le Fondre, the realist, said: "We should have taken our chances – I should certainly have taken mine. Everyone says luck evens out over a season but it seems to be going from bad to worse for us." Through an interpreter, Pochettino said he was "really happy". Was he aiming for a top 10 finish? "We have to know how to deal with victories, we have to enjoy them but not get carried away. We can't afford to let our guard down and we need to focus more on the games ahead." He sounds like a Brit already. Man of the match Jay Rodriguez (Southampton)

The only encouraging aspect of Stoke City's slide into the mire is the demeanour of Tony Pulis. The players are devoid of ideas and confidence is shot, as this dismal defeat illustrated. Yet their manager was calm when discussing how they will try to add to an alarming count of only five points won in 2013. Pulis is the veteran of a final-day escape from relegation in 2003 during his first season at Stoke, and in a 20-year seven-club managerial career the 55-year-old has yet to make the drop. "The first two seasons were difficult, very difficult," he said, before impressing how important it is to pass his experience on to the players. "I've been in it, the first season I was here we stayed up in the last game against Reading. But the most important thing is to look after the players and give them the confidence to go out and play." Still, this is Stoke's fifth Premier League campaign and after finishes of 12th, 11th, 13th, and 14th, this is the most precarious position they have been in since promotion in 2008. Of his record of never taking a club down, Pulis said: "No, but that's in the past, we have to look at the future. The important thing is getting the players' confidence together. We have to keep working hard and believe. As a manager, I'll keep fighting on." Pulis's future appears in doubt because of the side's awful form, and the dismay from disgruntled fans who have started to turn on him. His chief scout Lindsay Parsons's admission last week that he does not agree with Pulis's preference for tall players or his style of play was also ill-timed. While Pulis, admirably, stated he likes having strong characters such as Parsons around him, the view of many is that Stoke's plan A is, indeed, a lump-it-and-hope approach with no plan B. This was what allowed Aston Villa to win. When Pulis's side had the ball it was too often hit high and possession was ceded. Paul Lambert's young team prefer to pass and they did so with ease through the lumbering home side. Asmir Begovic and Charlie Adam each agreed Stoke are now in serious danger. The goalkeeper said: "We realise we're in a dogfight. We've been in this position before, the club's been here before, but hopefully the spirit of the club will take us through, the support can get behind us and we can pull through together. We've got six tough games left." These start with a difficult trip to Manchester United before their fellow strugglers Queens Park Rangers, Norwich City and Sunderland are encountered, then Tottenham Hotspur and Southampton close off the season. Adam said: "We are in the relegation scrap now. It's about characters and we will see how good the character of the group is. That's got to be the question now and we have to step up to the mark." Villa's technical superiority was illustrated by a brilliant second goal. Gabriel Agbonlahor's early opener was cancelled out by Michael Kightly with 10 minutes left as Stoke appeared to have snatched a point. But up stepped Matthew Lowton 25 yards out from goal to chest then volley the sweetest of strikes that had Lambert purring about it being the best anywhere in Europe. Christian Benteke confirmed the three points with a 15th league goal of an impressive debut campaign. Lowton, a 23-year-old bought from Sheffield United last summer and who has played every minute of Villa's league campaign, was modest about his wonder goal. "I was concentrating on my first touch and as soon as it settled it needed hitting. Luckily it flew in the back of the net," the defender said. "The timing shot them down, and I think their confidence dropped when that happened. We went on to get the third." Villa are now three points above the relegation zone and only one behind Stoke. Of their prospects of staying up, Lambert said: "I don't know but what you realise is that you are pulling a lot of teams into that group. You've just got to look at the ones above you and try and keep pinning them back." Pulis's side now have unwanted membership of this in-peril gang. Man of the match: Matt Lowton (Aston Villa)

Arouna Koné has cast himself as the leader of Wigan's latest merry dance away from the relegation zone. Joy reverberated around the ground when, with nine minutes remaining, the Ivorian forward's 10th goal of the campaign, a thumping drive, lifted the Lancashire club out of the bottom three. Such is their recent history that supporters anticipate it being a position they hold come six o'clock on 19 May. Of the banners that littered the stands, one read "We're Wigan, we'll do this" and another simply said "We believe". Nothing seems to rouse Roberto Martínez's men like a whiff of the daffodils; spring in the air is met with a spring in the step. This time last year they were a week into an extraordinary run of seven wins from their final nine matches; two years ago, they claimed 15 points from a possible 27 to clamber out of the drop zone. "When you're in this sort of situation what you need most is someone who can score crucial goals, and we've got that in Arouna. Getting into double figures in this league is no mean feat," said Wigan's captain, Emmerson Boyce. "He's come into great form at the right time of the season, just when we needed him to. He's on fire at the moment. "When Arouna scored it felt like the lid came off the DW. We get stick over the number of fans we've got, but they really make a noise and get behind the team. There's a great mood around the place at the moment, and we want to keep that going." Indeed, the scenes that greeted the decisive moment of a cagey affair were reminiscent of Charles N'Zogbia's last-minute winner over West Ham in the penultimate match of the 2010-11 season. But there was also a sense of inevitability about it. "We've been in this situation so often that we don't tend to panic. We were pressing hard and we deserved this win," said Boyce. "That's not luck – it's down to spirit and determination." But if this cosmopolitan bunch of Red Adairs can cope with this habitual pressure – this was their fifth win in six in all competitions – why can't they avoid it occurring by winning before Christmas? "Because once we get in the last third of the season we know that every point counts and is going to have an influence on our future," explained Martínez. "When you are at a big club you are expected to win every game, that's already there automatically, but it is something we need to create internally. "I want to change the perception of the club. We are not expected to win a game in August, September or October. We want to win it, but we don't have to win it, and that's probably because, as a club, we are still enjoying our journey in the Premier League.. We had an outstanding end of last season, and the pundits in the summer made us favourites to go down. The perception from the outside somehow affected our start." Wigan displayed the greater energy and endeavour as the game drew towards its conclusion – belying the fact their players had travelled a combined 120,000 miles during the previous week of World Cup qualifiers – to maintain their momentum. "This is the proudest moment of the season for us: the first time we have beaten Norwich in our history, the first time we win a game after an international break and the first time we win back-to-back [top-flight] games at the DW Stadium. Many records we had to overcome and we were a little fatigued," Martínez said. "I know what we've got and the club is incredible in facing adversity." He signs off his programme notes with the Spanish words sin miedo, which mean "without fear". His team are heeding his command, but for a Norwich side who have mustered only five top-flight goals in 2013, worry lines are becoming discernible. When they beat Wigan in December, a survival fight was the last thing on their minds, but just one victory in 14 since has led midfielder Robert Snodgrass to admit: "We are only four points away and we need to pick up points fast. We need to believe in ourselves that we are going to win games. Wigan were clinical and that is why they are in the Premier League." The chances of that being the case for a ninth straight season improve with every passing hour. Man of the match Arouna Koné (Wigan)

The Blackburn Rovers manager, Henning Berg, reportedly stormed out of the club's Christmas party after he was made to wear a Michael Jackson wig and dance on stage. Berg, who has led the club to only one win in his nine games since the club's owners Venky's appointed him to replace Steve Kean, was attending the party on Monday for players and 200 staff at Ewood Park, which it was hoped would lift morale. The incident reportedly took place when a club executive volunteered Berg to go up on stage with the DJ. Berg was first encouraged to wear a Christmas stocking and dance in front of the crowd, at which point he is said to have become "visibly angry". When someone then tried to put a Michael Jackson wig on his head, he reportedly ripped the stocking off and left the stage. The Daily Mail said Berg "made his excuses to guests at his table before making an early exit". In a statement, Berg said: 'On Monday evening, the club arranged its official Christmas party for all employees and staff. We have many hard-working employees and this was an opportunity for them to relax and enjoy themselves after what has been a difficult year. "After the dinner I was asked to go to the stage, which I was happy to do, believing I would be asked a few questions or maybe judge a competition. "Instead I was asked to do things which were not the right things for me to do as the manager, considering our league position and form. I did not want to do it and went back to my table. Later, I left the event at around 9.30pm, as planned, and drove home. The players left straight after dinner and no alcohol was consumed." With Blackburn 15th in the table, speculation has mounted over the manager's position. However, after their 2-0 defeat away at Blackpool, Berg insisted he was relaxed about his future. "I don't know how much the players heard of what was being shouted at them by the fans, but I don't think too much about my own position."

This was a meeting between two exponents of this season's standard Premier League formation. Whereas English football was traditionally obsessed with 4-4-2, and then 4-3-3/4-5-1 became fashionable midway through the last decade, now the most popular strategy is to defend with two banks of four, featuring disciplined wide players flanking two holding midfielders. Meanwhile, a central creator stays high up the pitch in support of an out-and-out striker. For elite teams who dominate possession it is designated a 4-2-3-1, while more modest sides such as Norwich and Sunderland are regarded as playing 4-4-1-1 – but the general idea remains the same. With two similar systems the key to the tactical battle was not the formations but the strategy without the ball. Norwich have been impressively structured recently, with Chris Hughton relentlessly drilling his players on the training ground – the wide midfielders protect the full-backs excellently, while Alexander Tettey and Bradley Johnson sit solidly in front of the centre-backs. Norwich don't always win the ball quickly but they're able to withstand pressure admirably. On the other hand, Sunderland's most obvious strategy was a high defensive line, which has become the obvious approach against Norwich – Southampton did exactly the same thing on Wednesday night in a 1-1 draw at St Mary's. It's easy to see the rationale; Grant Holt is an aerial threat but unlikely to cause problems through pace in behind the defence, so it makes sense to push up and force him away from goal. But Norwich exploited Sunderland's high line excellently for Anthony Pilkington's strike, which mixed good possession play with a sudden, quick forward pass from Johnson in midfield. The key was the combination of the two approaches; after more than a minute with the ball the unexpected directness came as a surprise to the Sunderland backline. More specifically, Norwich had worked the ball backwards from the opposition third to their own defence, which meant Sunderland's back four were gradually edging up the pitch, trying to squeeze the play – they were abruptly forced to turn round by Johnson's pass. When combined with Matthew Kilgallon loitering behind the rest of the defence, it resulted in Norwich's crucial second goal. Sunderland's high line was at least combined with good midfield pressing, and after half-time they had consistent spells of pressure by winning the ball quickly and pinning Norwich backinto their own third, although Hughton's side are well-versed in this type of defending. The away side's pressure resulted in various goalscoring opportunities – but chiefly from set-pieces, because Sunderland still lack creativity in the final third. Stéphane Sessègnon had a fine chance midway through the second half but rarely looks to unlock the opposition defence from between the lines, so a lot of faith is placed in inconsistent wingers James McClean and Adam Johnson to provide good crosses. Better finishing would have snatched a point but Norwich were more cohesive with and without the ball, and are currently a finer example of how to play this system. Lambert wings it Paul Lambert switched to a 3-5-2 system for Aston Villa's trip to QPR on Saturday afternoon. Although Lambert frequently changed formations last season when in charge of Norwich last season, since taking over at Villa Park he's remained committed to a four-man defence, so it was a surprise to see him select a backline of Ciaran Clark, Chris Herd and Nathan Baker, with Matthew Lowton and Eric Lichaj pushing forward from wing-back. The experiment wasn't entirely successful. Villa started brightly, and they defended the penalty box effectively, but it allowed the QPR full-backs an incredible amount of time on the ball; Armand Traore was disappointingly conservative on the left but José Bosingwa motored forward without any pressure. QPR's equaliser came after a cross from the right, as Bosingwa laid the ball back for Samba Diakite to cross, and it felt like Harry Redknapp's side should have made better use of their advantage down the flanks. The half-time departure of Esteban Granero was frustrating in this respect – he was the perfect man to spread play from side to side. Rooney profits from dropping deep Wayne Rooney again showed his versatility in Manchester United's 4-3 win at Reading on Saturday afternoon, spending the majority of the game on the right wing. It was a good example of his willingness to sacrifice his attacking game for the sake of the team – although he scored twice, these goals came from his only two attempts at target, and he spent much of the game in deeper positions. In fact, since the arrival of Robin van Persie, Rooney has reverted to being more of a creative player than a goalscorer. He's only scored in two matches this season – Saturday was his second double, after doing the same at home to Stoke in October – but with seven assists from 11 games, no other Premier League player has directly created so many goals for team-mates.

Guardian writers' predicted position: 5th (NB: this is not necessarily David Hytner's prediction but the average of our writers' tips) Last season's position: 4th Odds to win the league: 25-1 Tottenham Hotspur are a little like a groom on the night before his wedding. The excitement is palpable, as they stand on the brink of the best of times. They have so much going for them. There are nerves, lots of them, but they reassure themselves that everything will be all right. At the back of their minds, though, there is the fear that it could go horribly wrong. Two days before their season starts with a testing assignment at Newcastle United the fans look at the squad list and see only one established striker in Jermain Defoe. They know that Scott Parker, a talisman for much of last season, will not play until October at the earliest because of achilles surgery and another important midfielder, Sandro, has not yet trained under the new manager, André Villas-Boas, due to international commitments with Brazil. And then there is Luka Modric, whose transfer saga has bubbled in the background for the second successive summer. When Villas-Boas was introduced as Harry Redknapp's successor on 11 July he spoke of the requirement to "complete" the squad. Jan Vertonghen and Gylfi Sigurdsson had been announced as encouraging early signings but there remained imbalances, particularly up front. The club's inability to address them quickly has not helped Villas-Boas's preparations and it has been easy to remember the beginning of last season, when late incoming business, injuries and Modric's state of mind made for a stuttering start. Villas-Boas has reason to be more nervous than most, although he has not shown it. He has presented a supremely bullish front, saying that Tottenham ought to be genuine title contenders from the outset and even aiming a pop at Roman Abramovich, his employer at Chelsea last season, for failing to "put up to the things that he promised". Not many people take on Abramovich. Villas-Boas must restore the damage to his reputation that was caused when Abramovich sacked him eight months into this Chelsea contract. The pressure on Villas-Boas will be intense, largely because Redknapp was dismissed by the Tottenham chairman, Daniel Levy, after overseeing fourth-, fifth- and fourth-place Premier League finishes, which represented the club's most consistently impressive achievements since the halcyon days of the early 60s. The bold decision to sack Redknapp was tied up in the latter's desire to manage England and it was underpinned by a personality clash between manager and chairman. The bottom line, though, was that Levy felt Redknapp had taken the team as far as he could and that Villas-Boas is the better bet for the future. For Villas-Boas the margin for error would appear nonexistent. (As an aside, one of the great unanswered questions is whether Levy would have dismissed Redknapp if Chelsea had not won the European Cup and fourth place would have been enough to take Tottenham back into Europe's elite competition.) Levy's transfer dealings in the next two weeks or so will be vital but there is a confidence at the club that everything will be resolved to their satisfaction. The chairman always leaves things late, for better or for worse, although the delay in the permanent acquisition of Emmanuel Adebayor has not been his fault. He agreed a fee of £5.5m with Manchester City weeks ago for the striker, who spent last season on loan at White Hart Lane, and Adebayor's personal terms have also been fixed. The problem has been between Adebayor and City over a huge termination-of-contract payment that the player maintains he is entitled to. Villas-Boas would like another striker and the club are in talks with Internacional over Leandro Damião, the Brazil No9, while they also have an interest in Fernando Llorente of Athletic Bilbao. In goal Villas-Boas would ideally like an upgrade on Brad Friedel but, as yet, Lyon's Hugo Lloris has proved too expensive. Julio Cesar of Internazionale would be a much cheaper alternative. It is unlikely that Modric, who has trained away from the first-team group, will again be denied his move, even if Levy has resolutely held out for £40m from Real Madrid and the Spanish club have refused to go much higher than £30m. Levy turned down a package worth £40m last time out from Chelsea. The key difference this summer has been that Tottenham are prepared to sell. The club have raised about £14m through the sales of Niko Kranjcar, Vedran Corluka and Steven Pienaar but they need the Modric money to make their final signings. Villas-Boas has tracked the Porto midfielder João Moutinho as Modric's possible replacement, while the club have seen a bid rejected by Rennes for Yann M'Vila. Porto's president, Pinto da Costa, would demand at least €30m (£23.5m) for Moutinho and, like Levy, he is not a man to back down easily. Tottenham, as ever, are juggling many balls during the transfer window – they unsuccessfully bid €16m for Bologna's attacking midfielder Gastón Ramírez, according to the player's agent – and the north London club are also open to moving on a section of their squad: Heurelho Gomes, William Gallas, Sébastien Bassong, David Bentley, Jermaine Jenas, Giovani dos Santos and even Rafael van der Vaart face uncertain futures. Tom Huddlestone has been left frustrated at his lack of pre-season minutes, after recovering from a long-term ankle injury. Villas-Boas wants to play his high-intensity pressing game, with an emphasis on slick passing and movement, and his back four would appear to have the requisite pace. Younes Kaboul is expected to partner Vertonghen in the centre, with Kyle Walker and Benoit Assou-Ekotto sure to relish their attacking responsibilities in the full-back positions. With Ledley King retired, the 20-year-old Steven Caulker has the opportunity to press his credentials. The captaincy is an interesting issue, with Villas-Boas yet to confirm who will take over from King. Michael Dawson is an obvious contender; he has done the honours in pre-season and he has the respect of the dressing-room. But is he a certain starter in the team? Parker is another option, even if he is some weeks from fitness. He limped out of England's Euro 2012 quarter-final defeat against Italy on 24 June, because of a long-standing achilles problem, and so it was a curiosity that he did not undergo the operation until 8 August. Expect Villas-Boas to smile at the English fixation with the armband. The Portuguese must have been pleased so far at how his players have embraced the structure of his training sessions and his ideas. The perception has built, not without foundation, that this Tottenham squad is a more malleable bunch than the one he had at Chelsea. Pre-season has been gruelling, particularly in the 38C heat of Baltimore, but morale is good at present. The players enjoyed the tour of the United States, where highlights included their Fifa 13 console tournament at New York's Grand Central station and Vertonghen's initiation ceremony, when he sang The Beatles' Yellow Submarine. The serious business now looms, both in the market and on the field. Predictions are difficult for Tottenham while the transfer window remains open but one thing is clear: it will be emotional.

A springboard or a trapdoor? Aston Villa's next match could serve as one or the other. Paul Lambert knows that if his team overturn a 3-1 deficit when they host Bradford City in Tuesday's Capital One Cup semi-final second leg, then his young squad will enjoy a confidence infusion that could help them stay afloat in the Premier League. Suffering elimination at the hands of a struggling League Two team, on the other hand, would submerge Villa in further gloom. There is no possibility of a glorious failure to reach Wembley now. Only a comprehensive victory will atone for their shambolic showing at Bradford while increasing belief that this side have the wherewithal to survive a relegation fight. "We have to get there," Lambert said. Simple as that. This rambunctious derby with West Bromwich Albion was a useful preamble to the semi-final. It was played amid a frenetic atmosphere and, as is turned out, showcased a team's ability to come back from two goals down. Unfortunately for Lambert, it was West Brom who mounted the recovery as they reversed the 2-0 half-time score to salvage a point and stop their own run of defeats. Lambert was aghast at the manner in which his team conceded the goals, especially the second one, which, after Chris Brunt had halved Villa's lead, was scored by Peter Odemwingie after they failed to cope with a corner. That has been a recurring theme for Villa since long before Lambert's arrival: they conceded more goals from set pieces (25) than anyone else in the Premier League last term and are on course to repeat that again this season, having let in more than everyone bar Wigan (both have conceded 15). Bradford are aware of this weakness, with their manager, Phil Parkinson, announcing before the first leg that they would seek to exploit it: lo and behold, all three of their goals originated from corners by the midfielder Gary Jones. Lambert admits the persistence of the problem is driving him "potty" but says there is no easy solution: players simply have to try harder to prevail in the air. "It's not rocket science," Lambert said. "We go man for man and if it's your man that scores, then we know who was to pick him up. It's you against your opponent, and you've got to go and put your head on it." Ron Vlaar, whose return to action against WBA after a two-month absence through injury added valuable experience to Villa's rearguard, said: "If you can't head it yourself you have to make sure your opponent doesn't either." On the plus side for Villa, the first half gave a reminder of the attacking power that had been dormant since their superb victory at Anfield over a month ago. Christian Benteke was, in the words of the Albion goalkeeper Ben Foster, "a beast" and "unplayable", a point best made by the striker in the 12th minute when he outwitted Claudio Yacob before firing a ferocious 25-yard shot into Foster's net to give Villa the lead. When Villa get in the groove, they are about much more than Benteke: they can pass and move with wonderful incision and cause bemusement as to why only Queens Park Rangers have scored fewer goals than them in the top flight this season. Encouragingly for the remainder of the campaign, Charles N'Zogbia emerged as an unlikely source of sorcery. The Frenchman has missed much of this campaign through injury but when he has played he has rarely been influential, which is why few Villa supporters were counting on the man they signed for £9.5m from Wigan in 2011 to spearhead the club's survival bid. At The Hawthorns, however, he proved that he can be an important player in the run-in, excelling in a free role behind the front two. With penetrative dribbling and perceptive passing he set up Gabriel Agbonlahor's goal and created several chances for Villa to put themselves even more than two goals in front by half-time. "Charles and people like that create things where other people might not try, they've got the ability to make things happen," Lambert said. "You can take them making mistakes here and there because they're trying things somebody else won't try." The manager's decision to withdraw N'Zogbia in the 67th minute with the score at 2-1 raised eyebrows but Lambert explained it was done out of concern for the player's fitness. It looks like he will need N'Zogbia for the fight ahead, starting against Bradford on Tuesday. Man of the match Charles N'Zogbia (Aston Villa)

When Gervinho scored the winner for Ivory Coast against Togo with two minutes to go on Tuesday, his team-mates celebrated with surprising intensity. Yes, they had just won a game they had looked like drawing, and spared themselves an awkward postmortem, but there seemed something more. Didier Zokora held Gervinho by the shoulders and shook him, clearly saying something to him of some profundity. It's difficult to be sure, and the players subsequently revealed nothing explicit, but the body language suggested his was a huddle of encouragement, as though senior players were saying to Gervinho something along the lines of, "See, we knew you could do it…" Gervinho's goal was a reminder of what a gifted player he is. As the Togo goalkeeper Kossi Agassa missed Yaya Touré's deep free-kick, the ball fell to Gervinho just below waist height, at a narrow angle to a gaping net. It was easy to imagine him, given how he has played for Arsenal recently, being unable to decide whether to head or volley it and ending up falling in an ungainly heap as he tried to do both. Instead, though, he flicked the ball firmly with the outside of his right foot to secure a win Ivory Coast seemed to have surrendered by conceding a soft goal from a corner on the stroke of half-time. Being gifted, though, is not enough. It's one thing to own a Stradivarius, quite another to be able to play it properly. Gervinho went into the Cup of Nations in 2010 hyped as the player who would add dash, sparkle and imagination to a Côte d'Ivoire side based largely on pace and power. He would, we were told, give them something unpredictable. He did that, all right, although perhaps not necessarily in the way Ivory Coast would have hoped. Gervinho began that tournament well, scoring a tap-in and sparkling in a 3-1 group-stage win over Ghana in Cabinda, a game that was understandably overshadowed by the terrorist attack on the Togo team on their way to the city a few days before. He was as guilty as anybody, though, of losing his head in the quarter-final against Algeria, when Ivory Coast lost despite taking the lead in the 89th minute. Last year, in Equatorial Guinea and Gabon, the wildness, the occasionally bizarre decision-making, was clearly in evidence. Yet his team-mates clearly have great fondness for him. Didier Drogba was frequently petulant in his time at Chelsea but in an Ivory Coast shirt he becomes almost statesmanlike, the oldest player of the so-called golden generation and very much the leader. There were times in Malabo and Libreville when you could almost see Drogba suppressing his temper, making himself be encouraging. Gervinho is 25 – was 24 then – but still seems to be treated as the baby of the squad – in part because he is younger than the rest of the golden generation, perhaps not even fully part of it. There is a recognition of his fragility. He scored a wonderful winner against Mali in the semi-final last year, running from the halfway line before finishing with surprising calm, but when it came to the shoot-out in the final, he snuck farther and farther back. At 7-7, Ivory Coast's coach, François Zahoui, ordered him to go forward; he refused, and Kolo Touré's penalty was saved. Rainford Kalaba fired over the bar, which meant that Gervinho effectively had to go forward. Drogba hugged him – not a manly, darts-player hug, but tight to his chest like a father comforting his son. Gervinho, with sapping inevitability, missed. His form since has got worse and worse. At Arsenal he has become almost a joke figure. There is a fan who sits in front of the press box at the Emirates who has an enormous quiff and habitually wears an orange overcoat who seems these days to attend games for the express purpose of abusing Gervinho. He may be an extreme case but it doesn't take much for fans to become impatient with Gervinho these days. And as their impatience has grown, so has Gervinho's confidence dipped – and he seems very much a confidence player. A player that fragile will probably never be a consistent performer at the highest level. The very best players have a mental toughness that allows them to put mistakes behind them. Even if he did, his inability to pick the right option on a reliable basis is a major failing. But what is significant is the difference in attitude between Ivory Coast and Arsenal – perhaps between country and club. The Ivorians know that, for all his failings, he's the best they've got and so it makes sense to try to get the best out of him; at club level, the attitude – among fans at least – seems to be to highlight his deficiencies so that he's got rid of and replaced sooner rather than later. The result is that Gervinho tends to play better for Ivory Coast than he does for Arsenal. In a largely pedestrian Ivorian performance, in which passes were too often misplaced, he added energy. He operated both to left and right but was more effective on the right, his dart into the box creating the space for Yaya Touré's opener, although the ball broke to the midfielder as Gervinho was tackled rather than from a deliberate cut-back. Even if his delivery can be unreliable, his tricksiness gives Ivory Coast an extra dimension. Other 25-year-olds might feel patronised by the constant encouragement, but it seems to be what Gervinho needs to thrive. Arsenal's frustration with him is understandable but in a supportive environment, he can still be a dangerous player.

Manchester United put in a decent performance for once at home against Stoke City, and in the press room after the match the in-house television channel was naturally full of it. We are back to our best, was the slightly premature MUTV message, while up in Sunderland the noisy neighbours had only managed to “scrape a win” by a single goal. Everyone laughed at that, believing it was routine pro-United, anti-City bias, yet blow me when we all got home and watched Match of the Day on catch-up it was apparent Manchester City had only scraped a win. But for some Joe Hart heroics in goal Sunderland would have had at least a share of the points, and as Sam Allardyce said afterwards with any sort of finishing the relegation strugglers might have taken a giant stride upwards. The other thing that was apparent from the MotD highlights – well, more obvious actually – was that Leicester City are still not having any problems in the finishing department and are still on course for the shock of the new millennium. Jamie Vardy is now a contender to win goal of the season as well as player of the year, the Foxes have become the first Premier League team to hit 50 points, a five-point gap has been opened on Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal and their nearest challengers, Manchester City, lie in wait at the Etihad on Saturday. “Yes, of course,” said Claudio Ranieri, who possibly needed no reminding that the next two fixtures against Manchester City and Arsenal could define Leicester’s title challenge. “But we are in good condition and under no pressure.” The next two games will not define Leicester’s season – Ranieri, Vardy, Riyad Mahrez and a strong supporting cast have already done that – but if last season’s relegation escapees are still top by close of play on Valentine’s Day all the questions along the lines of “can they do it?” will have to stop. Because they will be doing it. Valentine’s Day, by the way, could have a major influence on the way the title and the top four work out. While Leicester travel to the Emirates, for what one imagines might be little reward given the way Arsenal carved them open to win 5-2 at the King Power back in September, Manchester City entertain Spurs so that all the present top four are in action against each other on the same Sunday. But first comes Saturday’s aperitif at the Etihad. The December meeting between the clubs was goalless and inconclusive, with Leicester glad of a point after suffering only the second defeat of their season at Liverpool the week before. This time practically everything is at stake, and though both managers would doubtless pooh-pooh the notion that titles can be decided in February, it should certainly provide a pointer as to who might finish on top. Leicester seem to be returning to peak form after a slight dip in effectiveness, personified by Mahrez performing at his best again after a quiet January. They are now out of the cups as well as out of Europe – not that they were ever in Europe – and, as Jürgen Klopp so succinctly remarked, their task now is simply to play a match a week while all their major opponents tie themselves in knots with fixture pile-ups. Manchester City may well view their next two games – against Leicester and Spurs, do try to keep up – as the last before their fixture programme becomes hectic. They have the small matter of an FA Cup tie at Chelsea on 20 February, followed by a trip to Dynamo Kyiv in the Champions League and then the Capital One Cup final against Liverpool at the end of the month. And they have just announced a managerial change, not exactly an unexpected one but a development that has been known to impact adversely on teams’ concentration and results in the past, especially as it has been widely suggested that when Pep Guardiola takes over he will have a significant amount of money to spend on new players. If the City squad all love Manuel Pellegrini as much as they say they do, the most desirable outcome would clearly be to win the title and perhaps another pot or two and dedicate the silverware to the outgoing manager. With the best of intentions, that is what the City squad will probably try to do, but it is easier said than done. Think back to when Sir Alex Ferguson said he was bowing out at United (several seasons before he actually did) then had to change his plans about retirement because his team’s attempt to win every game in his honour went so spectacularly awry. An outgoing manager, no matter how popular and successful, subtly changes the normal dynamic. An incoming one with money to spend does the same. Manchester City are not going to turn into a team of also-rans overnight; it is possible in fact that Pellegrini went public with the Guardiola news because he feared rumour and conjecture was already proving a distraction, but his team was not at its best on Wearside on Tuesday night and it could turn out that City are below par again at the weekend. Whereas the one thing Leicester have never been this season is below par. They have been fabulously above par, if that is not a golfing contradiction, punching above their weight from day one and using their relatively streamlined fixture programme to ensure they perform at their best for 90 minutes when a league game comes along. They are not so good as to go into Saturday’s game as favourites, but Manchester City will have to be at their best to beat them, particularly if Vardy and Mahrez get in among the still somewhat ponderous home defence. That is a huge compliment to Ranieri and his players, but only one of dozens they have thoroughly deserved all season. Regardless of the result at the Etihad, Leicester seem nailed on for a Champions League place whether they win the title or not. Yet Leicester would do well to shut their ears to such talk and concentrate on the main prize, in case they subconsciously begin to accept that finishing second or third would still be an outstanding achievement. It would, of course, but the outstanding achievement to end all outstanding achievements is still on offer. Ranieri is smart enough to know that, and so are his players. Klopp sounded like he had been mugged on Tuesday night, which is exactly the effect a team like Leicester should be aiming for. They are tough customers, you cannot argue with their approach, and at the moment no one is doing so. Manchester City, Spurs and Arsenal all have stronger squads but Leicester have proved brazenly effective at 11 v 11 contests over 90 minutes. There is still a way to go but if titles were won on verve and confidence the bookies would probably be paying out already.

Evening. Even the greatest empires crumble eventually. Why, in the 70s and the 80s, eminent historians will be fully aware that Liverpool were the dominant force in English football, but a little-known fact is that they haven't won a league title since 1990, after which the rot, or Graeme Souness, set in. Similar happened to Manchester United, on a smaller scale, at the turn of the century, when after three years on the top of the pile, Sir Alex Ferguson's second great side went into terminal decline. Various contributing factors are relevant here; bad signings, ageing players, a manager who loses the plot or sometimes the squad simply losing its hunger. That's what happened to Barcelona after they won the Champions League in 2006, having also won La Liga for two consecutive seasons. They were a great side, with Ronaldinho in his flamboyant pomp, Deco and Xavi pulling the strings and Samuel Eto'o, as he is for Inter to be fair, scoring goals with a ferocious intensity. But after that, things went to pot. Ronaldinho was a little too hungry, Eto'o's attitude slipped and Lionel Messi was injured too often, thereby allowing a distinctly mediocre Real Madrid to pip them to two league titles. Incredibly, the current Barcelona side is even better than the 2006 version; disconcertingly for them, this Real Madrid squad is also markedly superior to the shambles that masqueraded as champions back then. For the last two years, Barcelona have been the team to watch: fluent and mysterious in equal measure, with the exquisite partnership of Xavi and Andres Iniesta supporting the sublime skills of Messi in attack. True, they might not have won the Champions League last year, but it took a super-human effort from Jose Mourinho's Inter to stop them. And that's the almighty obstacle standing in their way this season: Mourinho. Mourinho's Madrid. So far this season, Barcelona have looked tired, as if they're feeling the pressure of a genuine challenge from the capital and the task of maintaining their own high standards. David Villa, their big summer signing, hasn't quite found his groove, Xavi is suffering from fatigue, they missed out on signing Cesc Fabregas from Arsenal and the side has been overly reliant on Messi in front of goal. To this observer, Mourinho and Cristiano Ronaldo seem to be a match made in heaven. We know all good things must come to an end. It would just be a shame if it happened to football's feel-good team. Team news: Barcelona (4-3-3, although it will probably end up 3-4-3 at most points): Valdes; Alves, Pique, Puyol, Abidal; Busquets, Xavi, Iniesta; Messi, Villa, Pedro. Subs: Pinto, Adriano, Mascherano, Keita, Bojan, Thiago, Maxwell. Sevilla ( 9-0-1 4-4-2): Javi Varas; Konko, Cáceres, Alexis, Luna; Perotti, Romaric, Renato, Capel; Kanoute, Luis Fabiano. Subs: Dani Jimenez, Cigarini, Escude, Dabo, Alfaro, Jose Carlos, Negredo. It's like 2004, Porto and Old Trafford all over again. Well, sort of. Jose Mourinho has been jumping up and down like a crazy person because two late goals from Cristiano Ronaldo has given Real Madrid a 3-1 win away to Hercules and ensure they stay top of the league, no matter what Barcelona do here. Sevilla took a right spanking here last season: 4-0, it was. And then again in the Spanish Super Cup in August, although they did win the first leg 3-1 at home. Xavi Hernandez is the new Ledley King. I've been waiting to write that sentence for years. Like the Tottenham captain, the Spanish maestro has an injury which means he has to pick and choose his games these days, which is a monumental shame. The teams are out. The melodic Barcelona anthem drifts out across Camp Nou. I whistle it a fair bit at home. Lovely tune. 1 min: Barcelona kick off, kicking from left to right. Pique and Puyol immediately set the tone for the rest of the evening, idly stroking the ball around at the back. And immediately Barcelona threaten! Villa slips Messi in behind the Sevilla defence. Messi gets to the byline and clips the ball back, Sevilla clearing it without much conviction. Abidal picks the ball up and rolls it to Xavi, in space on the edge of the area, and his fierce, swerving strike whistles a yard wide of Varas's far post. 3 min: Barcelona have started this one with a spring in their step, and are encamped in Sevilla's half. Sevilla can barely get move the ball further than 40 yards from their own goal. The pressing this team does is astounding. GOAL! Barcelona 1-0 Sevilla (Messi 4 min) This is about as one-sided a start to a match I've ever seen. Sevilla have barely touched the ball and the intense pressure has told. Villa spun on the edge of the area and hit a snapshot that was blocked by Caceres. The ball ran to Pedro on the left, who showed a fine turn of pace to get past Konko on the left. He chipped a cross towards Villa at the far post and Varas came off his line, all-a-flap to deal with it. His palm out only came to Messi, who took a touch and promptly drilled a hard shot through the bodies and underneath the goalkeeper. 6 min: And breathe. This one should have a few goals in it. 8 min: Sevilla still haven't mustered an attack. Tiki-taka is the order of the day so far. Barca are a different side when Xavi is fit and present. 9 min: Sevilla get into Barcelona's half! And what do you know, they nearly equalise! Konko glides inside and coaxes an intelligent pass behind the Barcelona defence. Pique lunges it but doesn't get enough on it to stop the pass reaching Luis Fabiano, who has darted away from Puyol to the right of the area. Fabiano shoots first time, past the dive of Valdes, but his effort skims a few inches wide. That was a good move, and deserved more. 11 min: Messi wins a corner for Barcelona on the left. Xavi takes it but it's headed away by Konko at the near post. 12 min: The workrate of Barcelona is quite remarkable and an object lesson for lesser sides who don't always put the hard yards in. More or less every time Sevilla try to play their way out of defence, they are eventually frustrated by a Barcelona interception. This sort of pressure puts an extraordinary strain on a defence. 14 min: All that said, Sevilla have at least managed to contain Barcelona better than they did in the first five minutes. Barcelona haven't had a shot since the goal. Fabiano is caught just offside on the right flank as he tried to latch on to another pass by Konko, Pique stepping up just in time, like a Spanish Tony Adams. Without the poetry and self-examination. 16 min: Teams must feel like the pitch is slanted towards their goal when they play against Barcelona. This game is being played more or less exclusively in Sevilla's half, sometimes 30 yards from their own goal. Busquets, ostensibly Barcelona's defensive midfielder, has made so many interceptions high up the pitch. 17 min: Barcelona have had 77% of the possession. So, for a shiny penny, how much have Sevilla had? 18 min: Wonderful interplay between Xavi and Abidal sets up a chance for Messi on the edge of the box, but Caceres halts his burst into the area. Inevitably Barcelona take control again and then, as you do, the supreme Xavi scoops a backheel to David Villa on the right of the area. He cuts inside, on to his left foot, but aims his shot too close to Varas, who holds well. 21 min: "Sevilla are an interesting story as well," begins John McLauchlin. "Their president has been in the news recently as he tries to wrangle a better TV deal from the big two in Spain. Although the club have always been setup to make a profit from player sales, a better TV deal and UEFA's financial fair play could change that. If even a few of the players (Keita, Ramos, Alves, Reyes etc) sold over the last few years had stayed on, they could have been challenging for the league." You're not wrong there, John, they were a very entertaining team to watch between 2005 and 2007. In fact, they've not been bad since then, but they were particularly good during that period. Kanoute is booked for asking for a yellow card for Xavi's scythe on Diego Capel. 23 min: Sevilla threaten again, and this would have been a superb way to bring the match level. Perotti darts down the right flank, holding off Abidal, before hoicking a dangerous cross all the way to the far post, over the snoozing head of Dani Alves. Capel meets it on the volley, but it's straight at Valdes. SENSATIONAL GOAL! Barcelona 2-0 Sevilla (Villa 24 min) Just inside Sevilla's half, Messi suddenly jinks away from Romaric and Fabiano. They might as well not be there, for all he cares. Suddenly expectation rises, he's running at the Sevilla defence. Instead of going for goal himself, he moves the ball over to Villa just to the right of the area. He glides inside past Luna, looks up, thinks 'I fancy some of this' and sends a sumptuous left-footed curler past the despairing dive of Varas and into the top corner from an absurd angle. Just superb. 26 min: This could get ugly for Sevilla, but they definitely have a goal or two in them. Barcelona, though, look like they have six or seven in them. 28 min: From a Sevilla goal-kick, Barcelona win possession and Pedro finds himself up against another wheezing Sevilla defender. He tries to twist his way past him on the left, but eventually Renato concedes a corner... 29 min: Some nonsense in the area between Alexis and Puyol ends with both players being booked. There didn't seem to be too much going on there. Eventually Xavi whips the corner in, and it's headed away easily enough. All that wait for that. 30 min: "Messi, what is he?" asks Niall Mullen. "Striker or winger? Or a ridiculously gifted combination of both? A Stringer perhaps? Either way it's all in the game." A glorious amalgamation of both, I'd say. It goes without saying that he's got the lot. Not very tall though - how would he do on a wet and windy Tuesday night away to Stoke? Let's see him defend a Delap throw-in, yeah? Withstand a Shawcross reducer. 32 min:Kanoute wants to be careful here. Already booked, he chops down Busquets, but escapes a second yellow. 33 min: The dangerous Pedro occupies two Sevilla defenders on the left, before firing a low cross in towards Xavi in the six-yard box. Xavi can't turn it goalwards though, Alexis putting it behind for a corner, which comes to nothing. 34 min: Messi finds space where there is none on the edge of the area. Eventually the ball just squirts away from him, but Iniesta wins a challenge with Renato 25 yards out, deflecting the ball back into Messi's path. He seemed a little surprised to have the ball again so quickly, maybe not realising that he had a bit of time, because his shot was a little rushed and went a few yards over the bar. 36 min: Romaric has a couple of nibbles at Xavi's achilles. Cynical? Xavi has been struggling with an achilles injury all season. 37 min: A great ball from Capel from the left has Fabiano interested, but Abidal just about manages to put him off, stopping him from getting a header on goal. Fortunately for Barcelona, the ball drops straight to Puyol rather than a Sevilla attacker and he clears. But Sevilla have looked dangerous every so often. 39 min: This has been a triumph for workrate. Not the blood and guts kind, merely diligent, intelligent harrying. 40 min: Varas preserves what little is left of Sevilla's dignity. Villa accepts a pass from Messi, before producing a great dragback away from Luna. From the right of the area, he aims a low effort towards the bottom corner, only to be denied by a superlative, sprawling save from Varas, who fingertips wide. 42 min: Konko clatters into Busquets and is booked for his troubles. Barcelona have a free-kick in the centre, 25 yards from Sevilla's goal. 43 min: Villa sends a disappointing effort straight into the wall. 44 min: Messi nearly plays in Xavi, but his pass is a tad strong and runs out for a goal-kick. 45 min: RED CARD FOR KONKO! Villa's brilliant, searching pass from the halfway line on the right to the left of the Sevilla's area is collected by Pedro. With Konko in close attendance, Pedro swiftly pokes the ball through his legs and is brought down by the right-back. The referee brandishes a second yellow card, and Konko can have no arguments with that decision. What was already going to be a long night for Sevilla has just got that bit longer. Half-time: Barcelona 2-0 Sevilla. The champions are on easy street. 46 min: Didier Zokora has come on for Perotti, and Dabo is on for Luis Fabiano. So, damage limitation for Sevilla then. Really, they've just got to hope that Barcelona get bored. This comes to mind. 47 min: "When you're 2-0 down," begins Gerry Armstrong on Sky, " I'd rather lose 3-0 or 4-0." Right you are. 48 min: "I agree Messi wouldn't like a midweek reducer fest up north," says Niall Mullen. "Mind you some of the things he does with the ball, if an English player did them you would be hearing about it for weeks." Yeah, how many England caps has Messi got? Villa and Alves play a clever one-two on the edge of the Sevilla area, the former managing to get a shot on target which is straight at Varas. 49 min: A waste from Messi here. We always knew he was rubbish. Xavi plays a lovely pass with the outside of his right boot to Messi on the right. He brings the ball forward and has two options, Villa or Pedro. He tries to find Pedro, but plays a strange pass, nowhere near his team-mate and it goes out for a goal-kick. 51 min: Barcelona are playing at walking pace at the moment, perhaps with one eye on the Champions League during the week. Xavi tries to find Messi with a cross, but it's too long. SHAMBLES! Barcelona 3-0 Sevilla (Alves 53 min) Iniesta's attempted pass inside Luna towards Alves is headed away by the left-back. Thirty yards out and facing his own goal, Romaric tries to head the ball all the way back to Varas but drops his header way too short and Alves shows great anticipation to get there first, sticking out a leg to loop the ball over the goalkeeper and into the net. What a farcical goal. 54 min: Nearly a fourth goal for Barcelona, but Varas denies Messi's close-range effort with his knees. The rebound comes back to Iniesta, who tries to curl it into the far corner but Romaric gets in the way. 56 min: The flag incorrectly goes up for offside against Alves after another awesome pass by Xavi. He really is some player. 57 min: "So we're agreed," says my co-commentator, Niall Mullen. "Leo Messi: he's no Tony Daley." Iniesta effortlessly wriggles away from Dabo on the left but rather than producing a cross, he runs the ball out of play. He can probably be forgiven for that. 58 min: One minute he's showing you the ball, tempting you, daring you to try and nick it off him. Then quick as you like, Messi whips it away from the defender and suddenly he's gone, that brief burst of acceleration always proving the difference. He passes to Villa on the right, but his cross is poor. 60 min: Alves goes down in the area under a challenge from Capel. He wants a penalty but that would have been soft. Barcelona make their first changes, Bojan and Javier Mascherano replacing Pedro and the excellent Xavi. 61 min: This one's basically over, but then we knew that after four minutes. Thirty minutes of exhibition stuff from Barcelona coming up. 62 min: Sevilla enjoy a bit of possession, but they're only going in one direction: all the way back to Varas. This is a thankless task for the visitors. 63 min: I've never seen a player clutch his face as much as Busquets. This time it's probably justified as Romaric's flailing arm catches him, but still. GOAL! Barcelona 4-0 Sevilla (Messi 64 min) Another brilliant goal. Messi shows great strength to barge Capel off the ball 40 yards from goal and then he puts the afterburners on, sprinting away from every desperate challenge. The Sevilla defence go this way and that, completely unaware of which way Messi is going to go, nearly tripping over their own feet, such is his instant change of direction. He hurtles to the left, opening up the angle for the shot, and from 20 yards out he places an unstoppable low skimmer into the bottom corner. 66 min: Puyol gets a nice little rest, the former Sevilla player, Adriano, on in his place. He'll go to left-back, meaning that Barcelona have two former Sevilla players in the full-back positions. Abidal slots into the centre. 67 min: Villa clips a cross back towards Messi on the edge of the area, forcing Zokora to head out for a corner. 69 min: Kanoute's night is over, here comes Alvaro Negredo. 70 min: "To answer the question raised in min 30, Messi is a striker; he hasn't played on the wing for the last season or so," says Jonathan Francis. "His increased goal rate is a direct result of him playing as a central striker, and I'd argue it's also why Ronaldo's ratio in Spain should be considered more impressive." 71 min: Is it a compliment to point out La Liga is an upmarket version of the Scottish Premier League? 72 min: It's an interesting concept actually. In Spain, we know only Barcelona or Real Madrid can win the title, while the teams immediately below them are relegated to the status of also-rans before a ball is kicked. In England, it's more or less certain that Chelsea are going to win the league, but their rivals (Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham) are arguably all better than the teams fighting for a Champions League place in Spain. Which is better? Probably the variety in the German league, as it goes. 75 min: I haven't paid too much attention to the last five minutes. Not much is going on, to be honest. We're playing out time, Barcelona might get a couple more goals, but they don't look particularly bothered either way now. 76 min: A rare foray forward from Sevilla ends with Negredo firing past the near post and into the side netting, via a deflection off Mascherano. The corner comes to nothing. 77 min: Fine play by Bojan as he holds off a number off Sevilla challenges, eventually winning a corner on the right. 78 min: Rather than whip the corner into the box, Barcelona decide to play keep-ball a bit more, just for the sheer hell of it. Then: pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass. Passy, passity, pass. Suddenly Iniesta seizes the initiative, gliding into the Sevilla area. He opens up his body and it looks like he's about to stroke the ball into the far corner, but he shows a rare moment of indecision, going for the perfect goal and his prod to Messi is cut out by a Sevilla interception. 80 min: Villa gets in behind the Sevilla defence again, this time from Messi's through ball. Varas comes out to meet him, but lovely quick feet from Villa help him to skip past the goalkeeper. The angle's tight but the shot is on target and would have gone in but for the covering of Dabo, who slid back to clear the ball off the line. 82 min: A first glimpse of Adriano, released by Messi on the left. But with space to deliver a cross, he gets the execution all wrong with Villa all along in the middle of the area, shanking the ball to Varas, who catches it. 84 min: Barcelona are toying with Sevilla, like a cat flicking a helpless mouse about. 86 min: Iniesta spanks a cross from the left towards Alves at the far post. Alves goes for the spectacular, trying to score with a difficult volley, but he's no Paolo Di Canio. Alves isn't really a right-back, is he? 87 min: Messi is after his hat-trick and is inches away from latching on to a long, raking pass from Alves. It just skipped away from him though. 88 min: Sevilla's night gets worse as Luna takes a cross from Alves plum in the face. That's got to smart. GOAL! Barcelona 5-0 Sevilla (Villa 90 min) Sevilla just can't live with the touch and movement of Barcelona. Who can? On the right touchline, Messi rolls a superb pass inside Luna towards Busquets. Busquets darts into the area before touching the ball back to Villa on the edge of the area, and he produces an exact replica of Messi's second goal. Peep! Peep! Peep! That was breathtaking from Barcelona.

Preamble: Sven-Goran Eriksson reneged on a gentleman's agreement to join Blackburn in 1997 simply because Jack Walker refused to approve the free-transfer signing of a 32-year-old Mancini from Sampdoria. In the end they both joined Lazio instead, where they won the league. At Blackburn, Eriksson was replaced at the head of the wish-list by Roy Hodgson, which didn't work out that well. At Sampdoria, Mancini was replaced by Daniele Dichio, which was even less successful. That today's coaches are members of some kind of mutual appreciation society is well known. They're pretty much the Mork and Mindy of football. "He is like my brother. I have know him for around 15 years. He is a fantastic coach and a fantastic man," says Mancini. "As a player, Mancho was a genius," says Eriksson. That's right, Mancho. "He saw things on the pitch quicker than anybody else. Sometimes even I would say, 'What is he doing?' And then, boom, you saw. Football? He knows everything about the game." And here, for the first time, they are rivals in the dug-outs. So that's the back-story. Watch out for meaningful man-hugs before kick-off and particularly lingering hand-shakes at the final whistle, possibly involving some eye contact and an earnest left-hand-on-right-shoulder clasp. All that, and the fact that Eriksson used to manage City, and Mancini made four starts during a brief spell at Leicester that started 10 years ago next week. And Darius Vassell used to play for Manchester City and now scampers about optimistically in a Leicester shirt. Also, Leicester have a bit of money. Manchester City have a lot of it. It's subtext city, it really is. And the game itself? Well, Leicester are at home, where their record is much better than their league position might suggest – they've lost just two out of 13 in the Championship. So there's certainly a chance of an upset, and that chance will almost certainly remain alive for longer than the possibility of a shock at Old Trafford earlier this afternoon. 3.34pm: And here, with no messing about, are some teams! Leicester: Weale, Naughton, Hobbs, Bamba, Berner, Abe, Wellens, King, Dyer, Vassell, Gallagher. Subs: Neilson, Teixeira, Oakley, Howard, Logan, Waghorn, Moussa. Man City: Hart, Boateng, Toure, Lescott, Kolarov, Wright-Phillips, Milner, Vieira, Adam Johnson, Jo, Tevez. Subs: Given, Zabaleta, Santa Cruz, De Jong, Boyata, Nimely, Ibrahim. Referee: Mike Dean (Wirral) 3.35pm: Oooh, it's the fourth-round draw! 3.37pm: I'll live blog the draw. Why ever not? It'll be conducted by some chap from the air force, and a bloke from the navy. But first, here's Stuart Pearce in Afghanistan. "It's the trip of a lifetime for someone like myself," says Psycho. 3.39pm: Pearce has complained about the dust, and is now being shown around "a patchy helicopter". 3.41pm: Torquay United v Crawley Town or Derby County! What a start! 3.41pm: Watford v Brighton! Wowee! 3.41pm: Bolton v Wigan! An all-Premier League humzinger! 3.41pm: Arsenal or Leeds v Huddersfield Town! 3.42pm: Fulham v Tottenham! A London derby! Of sorts! 3.42pm: Everton v Chelsea (or Ipswich, if there's a miracle)! 3.43pm: Southampton v Manchester United! The dream draw (unless Southampton fancy a place in round five)! 3.43pm: Burnley v Burton Albion! Er, not sure that's what Burton wanted. Also, I missed a tie. Sorry. 3.43pm: Birmingham City v Coventry City! Another kind-of-derby! 3.44pm: Notts County v Leicester City or Manchester City! So that's what today's victors have to look forward to, then. 3.44pm: Aston Villa v Blackburn - it's another all-Premier League draw. 3.45pm: West Ham v Nottingham Forest - "upset" ahoy! 3.45pm: Sheffield Wednesday v Wycombe or Hereford - that's last place on ITV's highlights programme sorted then. 3.46pm: That's it! Except for the two ties I didn't manage to type in before I forgot them. Doncaster or Wolves v Stoke or Cardiff, that was one of them. Too many ors in that one. 3.46pm: Chelsea now 3-0 up against Ipswich, incidentally. 3.47pm: So if Leicester win this, Eriksson will be up against his other English former employers. Uncanny. 3.59pm: The teams are preparing to come out and we're all set for 45 minutes of excitement. Leicester give a debut to recent signing Sol Bamba, the lanky centre-back who didn't do quite well enough when given a trial by Watford a couple of years back. MCFC are clad in their rather fetching away strip, and are all set to capitalise on Bamba's nerves after naming an attacking line-up. 4.01pm: Robbie Savage's pre-match interview with Roberto Mancini, which ended with the Welshman asking his former Leicester team-mate, in Italian, if there's any chance of him getting a contract offer in the summer, has been described as "a new low for televised sport" by emailer Adam Hirst. "I don't mind him as a summariser but never let him loose with a microphone anywhere ever again." 1 min: Peeeeeep! And we're off! GOAL! Leicester City 1 Manchester City 0 (Bamba, 1) And that's Sol Bamba scoring after less than a minute of his debut! Incredible scenes. Look at his face! Just look at his face! 3 mins: You'll win nothing with defending like that. A short corner was eventually swung into the penalty area, got flicked goalwards and an utterly unmarked Bamba poked in from four yards. Couldn't have been easier. 4 mins: Vassell, holding off three defenders in a manner which will be almost entirely unfamiliar to long-term followers of his career, wins a free-kick just outside the area. 5 mins: And it's swung over to the far post, where Jack Hobbs slams it goalwards with his mighty forehead only for Hart to push it away. The linesman reckons the ball was out of play before the header came in, but frankly I don't believe him. 8 mins: City finally get a spell of possession, switching the ball from side to side before eventually attempting a cross that sails out of play. 4.12pm: Vassell goes down under Kolo Touré's challenge, off-camera. The crowd bays but there's nothing doing whistle-wise. 11 mins: "Don't knock Robbie Savage," says Cali Davies. "In Denmark our commentator just saw a replay of the goal and said it was 2-0!" 12 mins: Edin Dzeko's in the stands, wearing his red-and-black MCFC scarf and wondering why he's not in Turin instead. 13 mins: Lovely burst by Milner to get to the byline on the right side of the penalty area, but his low pull-back is booted clear by Bamba. 14 mins: And from the corner, Vieira is unmarked to volley goalwards but there's no power on the shot and the ball is cleared. 17 mins: Leicester still doing well, though. Kyle Naughton looking good at right-back, and Vassell bright up front. 19 mins: Kolarov, with a trademark useless free-kick (is this unfair?), wins a corner when it deflects off the wall. GOAL! Leicester City 1 Manchester City 1 (James Milner, 23 mins) Leicester haven't coped well with Milner's breaks from midfield, and Bamba's hopeless attempt at a tackle is the latest and most painful failure. Milner cuts inside, Bamba doesn't get within three yards of the ball and the Englishman slams a left-footed short into the far corner from the edge of the penalty area. 25 mins: Manchester City's fans do not appear to be sitting down. At what point will they all be forcibly ejected from the ground? 26 mins: Many of them are looking away from the pitch and bouncing up and down. The remainder are looking towards the pitch and bouncing up and down. Either way, they're bouncing. 28 mins: Bamba's a tall lad, and roves upfront to win another header from a set-piece, though it's from too far out, and also not firm enough, or on target enough, to worry Hart. 30 mins: Carlos Tevez attempts a left-footed shot on the half-turn from 17 yards out, which flies over the bar. This is quite a fun match at the minute. 31 mins: The pitch, of course, is dreadful, but it's sticky enough to add a certain retro 1970s-era push'n'shove to proceedings. 33 mins: Stinging wondershot from Abe, left-footed and a good 30 yards from goal, which is flying goalwards before hart tips it around the post at full stretch. 34 mins: From the corner, Bamba thunders a header at goal that Hart does well to push away, and then scoops another effort from the rebound that Hart collects. "He's a better centre-forward than centre-half," we're told. 36 mins: Daryl Paskell reports that City's backwards bouncing is in homage to the Lech Poznan fans who were at it in a recent European tie. So there you go. 36 mins: And from another LCFC corner, another Bamba header – despite Boateng's muscular marking – doesn't quite lead to another goal. 38 mins: Chelsea now 7-0 up against Ipswich with 10 minutes to play. Roy Keane unlikely to be too displeased to miss it. 38 mins: Lovely ball by Wellens to play in King, but his first touch isn't great and takes him away from goal, and his shot is fairly easily saved. 39 mins: Hilarious miss by City. Boateng runs clear on the right, and he sends the ball low across the six-yard box towards Jô at the far post. But at the last moment Adam Johnson arrives and, at full stretch, slides in to toe-poke the ball away from his team-mate and wide. 42 mins: "Is Bamba the new Steve Walsh?" ponders Foxes fan Jim Harris. "Average defender but soon to be successful striker. Remember the play off final against Derby in 94?" Er, not especially but I remember Walsh well enough. GOAL! Leicester City 1 Manchester City 2 (Carlos Tevez, 45 mins) Another short corner poorly cleared, Milner is released by Johnson's clever reverse pass and his low, hard centre is backheeled in at the near post by Tevez. 45 mins: We'll have two minutes of stoppage time here. 45+2 mins: And that's the first half over. Breathless stuff, and all rather entertaining. Half-time: Incidentally, City were "doing a Poznan" in support of Neil Young, who scored the winning goal in the 24th minute when MCFC beat LCFC in the 1969 FA Cup final and has recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. Full(ish) story here. More at half-time: "From corners and free-kicks we've not been at our best, which normally we are," says Brian Kidd, who adds that MCFC should desist from their long-ball habits: "If we want to play behind, play behind just to drop it behind." 46 mins: Peeeep! We're off! Again! 46 mins: In team-sheet news, De Jong has replaced Shaun Wright-Phillips. 46 mins: Gallagher's excellent ball finds Dyer running across the penalty area, right to left, but his eventual shot is blasted wide. 49 mins: Noel Gallagher is here, but seems to be saying goodbye to whoever he's with. 50 mins: To avoid being drawn into referring to either side as "City" when they obviously both are, I will henceforth be referring to the teams as "Sven" and "Mancho", unless someone can suggest a better plan. 53 mins: Another Sven corner, another on-target header, though the latest header is a loopy little number that Hart cautiously beats away. 54 mins: Mancho do appear to think that marking is a little bit beneath them. 55 mins: Another Sven corner, another free header – this time Hobbs, who doesn't have to break his stride or even jump but still sends his effort well off target. 56 mins: After a niggly foul in the penalty area the ball rolls to Gallagher about five yards inside his own half and, just as the referee blows the whistle, he sends a glorious long-range looper arcing into the net. No goal, and he probably wouldn't even have tried had the whistle not gone, but a good bit of skill all the same. 60 mins: "With your tale of two cities dilemma, why not avoid confusion by calling them Manchester and Leicester?" suggests Mark Guthrie. Hmmm. But I like Mancho. 62 mins: Sven-Goran Eriksson's team seem set to rely on set-pieces or optimistic balls over the top for Vassell to run onto. 'Twas ever thus. GOAL! Manchester City 2 Leicester City 2 (Andy King, 64 mins) That's also dismal from Mancho. Gallagher's cross misses everyone but bounces awkwardly in front of Hart. He should really have caught it, but the ball bounces off his chest, King nips in and is left with an empty net to bosh the ball into. 66 mins: "A staggering number of tributes to Neil Young," says Colin Davidson. "And I was silly enough to believe that I was one of the few who thought he was elegant/fantastic." Before my time, I'm afraid, but the red-and-black-scarf tribute – to match the colours the side were wearing in the FA Cup final – seems to have been pretty much universally adopted. 68 minutes: "Why not go all Charles Dickens and name the MBM 'A Tale of Two Cities'?" suggests Shreerang Sarpotdar. "Highlighting as it does the gulf in living between the French aristocracy and the peasantry? Rather appropriate, I thought." 69 mins: Sven's equaliser was preceded by a few minutes of lah-de-dah passing down the left flank by Mancho. Pretty, but punished. 70 mins: But the last five minutes or so have been all – all – Sven. They're absolutely hammering on the Mancho door. 74 mins: De Jong has trodden on Wellens' finger, and the Sven midfielder is rolling around currently. Jô goes off, replaced by Zabaleta. He and Wright-Phillips were both very poor today. 77 mins: A special mention for Naughton, who just sprinted 40 yards at impressive pace to win a corner-he-shouldn't-have-got off Kolarov. Sven have replaced Gallagher with Waghorn. Hang on, no they haven't. They put up the board, he ran over, and then they put down the board again. 78 mins: Another Sven corner, another Bamba header, and Milner on the post heads the ball off the line. Sven's success rate at corners has been astonishing today. I'm honestly not sure I've ever seen a team win such a high proportion of headers from set-pieces. 79 mins: And now Waghorn is on, but Lloyd Dyer's the man to make way. 80 mins: Lovely move by Mancho, terrible miss. The ball is worked down the left, Tevez collects it in the penalty area, turns, lays it off for De Jong, arriving at pace, to side-foot straight into the keeper's arms from 12 yards. 83 mins: Now Steve Howard comes on for Vassell, who's done a pretty good job for Sven today. 85 mins: For those without televisions, or with televisions but without ESPN, here's Leicester's equaliser, in all it's Hart-humiliating horror. 87 mins: Shots on goal: Sven - 15; Mancho - 8. I'm willing to wager than Bamba has, on his debut, had more efforts on target than half Sven's squad have mustered all season. 88 mins: This time Bamba's doing his stuff at the other end, cutting out Kolarov's low centre before anyone can tap in. 90 mins: Bamba's had six shots, apparently, of which five on target. As Duncan McDonnel points out, Mancho should really be spelled Mancio, and certainly would be if I were Italian. 90 mins: There'll be three minutes' stoppage time. 90+1 mins: A decent build-up by Mancho, Milner plays in Tevez but his shot from an acute angle is turned past the post. 90+2 mins: Sadly the game's ending poorly, with lots of misplaced passes and Leicester, who started the half so strongly, camped in their own half. 90+3 mins: And the game ends with Berner hobbling off, and Robbie Neilson coming on. 90+4 mins: Peeeep! That's yer lot, and we're replay-bound! Final thoughts: Overall, a more than decent game, at least until it petered out with 10 minutes still to play. Very competitive, and if neither team managed to sustain a great level of performance for long, the pitch has to take some of the blame for that. Sven were impressively organised in defence, but for Bamba's disappearance before Mancho's equaliser, and the Swede remains unbettered by his erstwhile protege Mancini. "The stuff of dreams – they have a replay at Eastlands," hurrahs ESPN's presenter, which seems to be pushing it a little. Mancho's marking at set-pieces was probably the worst I've ever seen over the course of a single game, but by securing a replay they just about got away with it. Anyway, enough from me. Thanks for your company, and may I suggest that you continue your evening by following Real Madrid v Villarreal with John Ashdown here?

4.48pm: Hello and welcome to exclusively typed live coverage of the final Premier League game of the day, Birmingham v Arsenal. Arsenal can inch ahead of Spurs again if they win. Birmingham can scrabble out of relegation trouble. This could also be a spicy game, one of those clash-of-styles numbers that involves Arsenal being jostled and jounced and generally shoved about more than they'd like, but then complaining about it slightly too much if they end up losing. St Andrews is looking a picture as ever. A really depressing, grey, brutalist, Soviet era kind of picture. Your teams: Birmingham Foster, Carr, Johnson, Dann, Ridgewell, Larsson, Ferguson, Gardner, Bowyer, Beausejour, Jerome. Subs Taylor, Phillips, Derbyshire, Fahey, Zigic, Hleb, Jiranek. Arsenal Fabianski, Sagna, Djourou, Koscielny, Clichy, Walcott, Song, Wilshere, Nasri, Fabregas, van Persie. Subs Szczesny, Rosicky, Denilson, Squillaci, Arshavin, Eboue, Bendtner. 4.52pm: So Larsson plays against his old club, as could Bendtner and the hapless Hleb, who really did make a poor decision. 4.53pm: Interesting to see that Almunia has been told he can catch the next plane out of North London if he wants to. The only problem is... he'll probably drop it. I thank you. Flappyhandski plays again today but surely none of these goalies are good enough. Birmingam have some very tall men in their team. I predict a "bombardment". 5.23pm: Ian Copestake is also here all week: "Arsenal can confirm their championship credentials if they get a result here. 2-1 to Birmingham then." It is a big game for Arsenal, the kind they often make a mess of. But this is also a very nice looking - albeit quite small and slight - Arsenal team with a midfield made up of skilful scampering gnomes. 5.25pm: The teams are coming out of the tiny little cramped tunnel made of old plastic piping. Arsneal really are quite small, Djourou aside. 5.27pm: Nick White writes: "I see Birmingham have fielded the exact same team that they started in their previous game against Manchester United. Is there even the slightest chance that we'll see anything other than the negative tactics that they deployed in that game?" Maybe not, but they were playing the league leaders and a 1-1 draw isn't a bad result. Would you suddenly start trying to play like Hungary 1953? 1 min Arsenal kick off and poke it about a bit at the back. There's an early touch for nice, slightly confused-looking Ben Foster who hoofs it miles very hard and flat down the centre. More of that to come you'd think. 2 mins He's already done it again. Whump. Miles. Tussle, head, bounce throw-in. Repeat. 3 mins Walcott has an early scamper for Arsenal down the right, easily burning off Ridgewell but shooting into the side netting. He should be able to run past Ridgewell at will this evening. It's just what he does with it after that. 5 mins "We have some drizzle, which may help the players," says the man on ESPN. Why? Already sensing some stuff about greasy pitches and slick passing and the ball "gathering pace on this wet surface" coming up. 7 mins Arsenal free kick 25 yards from goal after Fabgregas is tripped. Van Persie wallops it right into the wall. Not even the top of the wall. The shins of the wall. 8 mins Oh dear. Johnson leaps into an absolutely shuddering tackle on Fabregas in midfield, leading to a mass chest-bumping posse around the writhing Spaniard. Johnson is booked but it really wasn't that bad a tackle given that you are allowed to try to win the ball. Fabregas is OK. Interesting that, you could really see the difference in slow-motion between a proper red card foul and what Johnson did there, going with one foot at ball height, just following through a bit too much. 11 mins foster handles a back pass and it's an indirect free kick inside the area. Fabregas rolls, Nasri dummies, Van Persie punts it goalwards and Foster leaps on top of it and holds on too. Adrian Cooper says: "Are Birmingham actually as bad as everyone seems to be saying at the moment, or are they just lacking goalscorers? Weren't they being feted as great last season at stages last season? And despite being 18th, their goal difference is only -3. There are plenty of other teams around them that are surely far, far worse." I reckon they're currently the 18th best team in England. 13 mins GOAL! Birmingham 0-1 Arsenal Van Persie has a third strike at goal from a free kick. It's not that much better this time but he does manage to hit Lee Bowyer in the stomach and the ball is deflected past Foster who had no chance. Van Persie won the free kick himself with a rather theatrical dive. Big Eck isn't happy, with some justification. 16 mins Arsenla are having most of the ball, moving the ball very nicely, with the odd rampaging Blues counter-attack when they manage to nick the ball. Set pieces. It's all going to come down to set pieces. 18 mins What a save by Fabianski from - yes - a Birmingham free kick, taken by Larsson about 20 yards out. He gave him the eyes, he put it to the keeper's side, not the wall's, and Fabianski leapt back across his goal to palm it away with a decisively non-limp wrist. Mike Down writes: "Birmingham are like a hard boiled egg... hard to beat! Chelsea had about 30 attempts on goal to Birmingham's ONE and lost 1 nil! This one's got nil v nil written all over it." I thought you were going to say surprisingly spongy and full of yellow gunk. I think we'll have more goals. Set pieces you see. Plus Arsenal are having so much of the ball they've got to create something. 21 mins Walcott goes off on a run. Jerome tracks him back. That was a decent race. Jerome won. The ball bobbled out of play. No actual football happened, just some sprinting. 24 mins This is getting a little spiky. Nasri and Larsson have a really weedy slappy kind of tangle that they're rescued from by the ref. Not exactly Jonny Giles and Peter Storey, that.There isn't much happening out there right now. But here's a set piece. Johnson and Dann lumber forward. 26 mins A massive scramble in the box ends up with Beausejour launching a comical mis-kick volley that bobbles sideways harmlessly. Back down the other end Van Persie has just missed a sitter after great work on the left wing by Nasri. Blimey Nasri is quick with the ball at his feet. Poor old Barry Ferguson was running backwards there trying to keep up. 29 mins Ridgewell has just been booked for fouling Walcott. Van Persie swings in the free kick and Djourou, unmarked, seems to back away form launching himself into a diving Andy Gray-style header and it just sort of bounces through to Foster. Odd, that. Big Eck is still very cross, this time about a handball he feels Blues should have had. 32 mins Arsenal are in total charge of the between-the-free-kicks actual football side of this match, but you just get the feeling they can still do something silly. Conal Huetter writes: "After Johnson's challenge on Fabregas, the commentators were giving him grief for showing his studs. My question is, and this applies to countless other challenges as well, is how do you NOT show your studs when slide tackling in such a manner? It seems that when tackling a player from the front (which is apparently the only legal way nowadays) you'd have to twist your foot around quite awkwardly to avoid showing the bottom of your foot." It was very minor, just a peek of studs. I'm not sure it should have been a yellow card. 35 mins Djourou is booked for not-very-much and both managers look very cross already. Birmingham punt in a deep free kick and there's some wild appealing for a handball as the ball is cleared chaotically. And blimey - that was a blatant penalty. Van Persie punched the ball away with his arm. No idea what he was thinking, or how the ref missed that. Amazingly, back down the other end Van Persie then misses another sitter, right through on goal. What an extraordinary game he's having. 37 mins Terrible miss by Johnson, right in fornt of goal. It came from another punted free-kick, flicked on by Jerome to Johnson unmarked six yards out and he shinned the ball over the bar. Birmingham may have just one tactic, but they are very good at it. Ben Dunn writes: "The stats guys can tell you how far a player has run, exactly where he has run and some other less important statistics actually related to football. But will they ever be able to throw out who is the fastest? Walcott over 20metres, and Lennon over 5 I'd say. Barry would probably be discovered to be an actual statue with robotic kicking legs." 40 mins More wild thrashing Birmingham pressure as another long high "pass" finds its way into the Arsenal box. Djourou is down injured holding his side after an aerial roughing up by Gardener. Arsenal broke again there and almost got through on Foster. There are goals here for them if they can get the last pass right. On speed I believe no one can match Walcott. He has a proper sprinter's style, all effortless gliding. Lennon waggles his arms a lot, giving the illusion of extreme speed, but he seems to stop accelerating after six or seven strides. 43 mins All Arsenal at the moment. They own the ball. It's just a question of what to do with it. 45 mins Carr launches a long throw into the box but it's nodded out. There's really only one side playing any football here. Two added mins of this. 45+2 mins HALF TIME Birmingham 0-1 Arsenal. A deserved lead - Arsenal might have scored four even though, to be honest, they never really looked like scoring four. Birmingham have shoulder-barged a chance or two from the sky and will point to Van Persie's clear handball in the box, but Arsenal are ahead on merit for their enterprise. I'll be back in a few minutes, at which point the word "analysis" will start to flash in your peripheral vision as I paste in some emails. Adrian Cooper writes: "Is Lennon actually as fast as we think he is, or does he just look so fast because his legs are so tiny? He probably has to take two steps for every one of a normal height player, or four steps just to keep up with each flex of Peter Crouch's little toe." ESPN's Burley and Parlour are saying Johnson should have been sent off for his tackle on Fabregas. Parlour is clearly an Arsenal fan, but Burley is also adamant it was a naughty one. Joshua Schaefer objects: "So just to be clear, Van Persie dived, the free kick was then deflected in, Birmingham should have a penalty and also missed a good chance and this translates to all Arsenal?" I'm a neutral but Birmingham have barely strung two passes together. Arsenal could have had four goals quite easily. They deserve to be leading. James Wells has been having a think: "I don't understand why there is so much disagreement over what constitutes a bad tackle. It seems like if you keep at least one foot on the ground, with the other foot not going over the half the height of the ball and do so while the player still has the ball it's not a foul. Taylor should have been sent off, not for breaking Eduardo's leg, but because he was entirely in the air and hit Eduardo mid-shin. Shawcross too. Wilshere should not have been sent off for his foul on Zigic because his feet never left the ground. He should have gotten a yellow for being late. Fabregas should have been sent off for his tackle on Ward because he was way late and his feet were off the ground. Eboue should always be sent off because his tackles are so, so late. We expect players to pull out of challenges on goalkeepers, why should it be any different with dangerous tackles on outfield players?" Yeah. What he said. Nicholas writes: "Possession is fairly equal, Arsenal's goal is controversial, blown penalty call, bad misses by Johnson and Van Persie and you say Arsenal deserve its lead and should have scored 4?" Could have scored four. Not should. Could. There is a big difference. Birmingham could have scored two, possibly, if they'd had that penalty and Johnson had shot on target. 46 mins Birmingham kick off again, their first set piece of the half and perhaps the only one they won't lump into the Arsenal box. Here's to many more. And there is the first long free kick punted forwards the Arsenal penalty spot. It's a foul and a free kick to Arsenal but they do always looks a little shaky when that ball comes booming in towards Birmingham's assorted giants. 49 mins Carr puts in an early second half reducer on Fabregas just as he nicked the ball away from him. Pow. That was a full body tackle, but fair enough in the end. Saltuk has a good idea: "Why don't the two teams settle the game as follows? Birmingham punters are granted 15 set pieces, 5 from the right, 5 from the left and 5 from the center. If they can't score and equalize, then the game ends 1-0 to Arsenal. In that way, everyone saves time and the players don't have to pretend in this god-awful weather." 52 mins Nothing has really happened yet this half. Walcott is dragged back by the arm by Dann, who gets a yellow card. That was sneaky rather than malicious and now Arsenal have a free-kick that they load into the box. Expertly defended and headed away cleanly by Johnson. 53 mins Bowyer stamped on Sagna's leg just before that free kick by the way. It was quite clear and would have been a card if the ref had spotted it. Meanwhile Arsenal tee up Wilshere with a spell of high speed jinky beach football but his side-footed volley flies over the bar. Lovely approach play but that was a wasteful finish, far too casual with the game still 1-0. 55 mins Nasri sprints through into a one-on-one with Foster, who makes a good tumbling save. "Carr doesn't dare touch him there or it's a pelanty," says Chris Waddle. 58 mins GOAL! Birmingham 0-2 Arsenal. That was a brilliant team goal, scored by Nasri but set up by a passage of about 25 passes across midfield, followed by a perfectly timed little lay-off from Fabregas into Nasri, who turns and passes it into the corner. When it works like that, Wengerball really does look great. 61 mins Hleb has just come on for Birmingham. They really do need someone to hold the ball a bit in midfield. Could the disapponting Belarussian be the man? 63 mins Wilshere is hobbling about after a stiff tackle from Gardener. When was the last time Birmingham scored twice in half an hour? They need something fairly sharp-ish here. Fabianski gets a free-kick for a very minor nudge by Jerome that he managed to turn into a spectacualr cartwheeling flip. 66 mins GOAL! Birmingham 0-3 Arsenal It's a slightly comical own goal off Johnson in the end but that was wonderful football from Arsenal in the build-up, Fabregas and Nasri combining really nicely, Nasri on the overlap slipping in a pass very close to goal that Dann scuffs on to his centre back partner. Who then deflects it into his own goal. Nothing he could really do about that, but some lovely attacking play in there. 69 mins Birmingham looked a little bewildered at the back there as that goal went in, perhaps disorientated by having to defend so deep against so much possession. Zigic has come on for Bowyer. So perhaps no real change in tactics on the cards. 72 mins It has been hard for Birmingham playing Man Utd and then Arsenal so close together. The high-energy way they play against the top teams must take a lot out of them. They do look a little less than sprightly here. Ben Dunn writes: "Hleb is a perfect example of a player leaving Arsenal and not being quite as good as the Wengerball style made them be. Is Cesc intelligent enough to see this trend? He does have the Barcelona contacts and must know Henry and Hleb's contribution to their Spanish world-conquering cause was less than central." Fabregas is in a different league to Hleb. Think he knows a bit more about Barca too. 75 mins Walcott gets in on the right again where Ridgwell has had a tough game and Foster gets down well to save. It's very easy for Arsenal now. Walcott then attempts a cheeky chip from outside the box that totally fails. Steady Theo: you're not quite there yet. 77 mins Arsenal are showboating a bit now and doing their Harlem Globetrotter bit in midfield. That might not be a good idea. No need to rub it in and make people cross. 79 mins Some head tennis in the Arsenal box ends up with the vast Zigic caught offside as he tries to butt the ball home. Wilshere and Walcott go off, Arshavin and Denilson come on. Jerome is also off. Kevin Phillips, amazingly, comes on. Yes that Kevin Phillips. The one from the 1990s. 82 mins Arshavin draws a smart low save from Foster after some wiffly, dreamy interplay in the build up. From a rehearsed corner routine Denilson then makes Foster save again from the edge of the box. Arsenal keep the ball, and then keep on keeping the ball. It's like a school match now where one side is a bit older and better and more organised than the other. 86 mins More of the same going on. Unless I specifically say otherwise, you can assume Arsenal are flitting the ball about nicely in midfield. On you know who to you know where Keith Smith writes: "You've got to wonder about Barcelona as well as the individual players who decided to move. Barcelona have now bought Overmars, Petit, Henry and Hleb from Arsenal. AC MIlan bought Flamini. None of them succeeded, and yet the penny does not seem to drop. its just that Wenger builds teams that are a lot bigger than the sums of their parts. Cesc Fabregas is better than any of the others that Barcelona bought, but he may be more intelligent also ... that's why he didn't move." On the other hand, as Damien writes, "There are not many key players who have left the club during or before their peak years. However look at Ashley Cole for an example that it isn't simply 'Wengerball' making players look good." 89 mins Tum-te-tum. Pass pass pass. Lay-off. Flick. Dann and Johnson both simultaneously tackle Van Persie as he seems poised to score. Great effort from the pair of them. 90+3 mins FULL TIME Birmingham 0-3 Arsenal. And that is that. Birmingham put a lot into the first half here and should have had a penalty when Van Persie handled. After that Arsenal dominated with an almost embarrassing ease. Birmingham looked tired, but they were also unable to cope with the movement and passing of Fabregas. Ridgewell hit the bar in the last minute with a header. It was as close as they got all game. Arsenal are now two points off the top two. Birmingham are two points off the bottom. That's all from me for now. Thanks for all your emails. Goodbye.

It's been a quite a week for Northern Irish sport. On Monday, Portrush's finest, Graeme McDowell, won the decisive match in the Ryder Cup to land the trophy for Europe. His team-mate Rory McIlroy, from Holywood, County Down, had earlier contributed a crucial half-point during the day's singles. And then, later in the week, at the Commonwealth Games in Delhi, the team picked up a silver and a bronze, a haul that put them only three places in the medal table behind Nauru, the world's smallest republic. But the golf's enough for one week, isn't it? Or is it? Now there's this Euro 2012 qualifier, and Italy aren't really up to much. They've only recorded two wins in the entire calendar year of 2010, although both of those came in their first two qualifiers last month, a 2-1 win in Estonia and a brave 5-0 tonking of the Faroe Islands. Their pool of genuine top-drawer acts, usually so deep, contains Andrea Pirlo, arguably Antonio Cassano, and, er, that's about it, really. And Italy very rarely run cricket scores up against supposed lesser sides, so the Irish needn't be too feared here. Still, new boss Cesare Prandelli, formerly of Fiorentina, has got the azzurri smiling again, and after that World Cup campaign, that's no mean feat. Of course, man for man they should still dispose of Northern Ireland without too much fuss. But ask yourself this. What price a country who can afford to leave the comically disruptive ninja skills of Kyle Lafferty on the bench? Also, the Italian central defensive partnership of Leonardo Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini has been shipping goals for fun at Juventus, so they'll not relish facing "rejuvenated" Sunderland reserve David Healy, hat-trick hero of that famous Euro 2008 qualifying win over eventual champions Spain. Nigel Worthington has been giving Healy the big talk; this would be a fine evening for a return to the sort of form that saw the striker score a record 13 goals in that last Euro qualifying campaign. Older Italians will also be mindful of this: This defeat at Windsor Park knocked Italy out of the 1958 World Cup, the only time they've failed to make it. (They didn't enter in 1930.) Sent off in the match was the naturalised Italian Alcides Ghiggia, who had previously scored the winner in the 1950 World Cup 'final' for Uruguay. Kick off: 7.45pm. Northern Ireland: Taylor, McAuley, Hughes, Craigan, Jonathan Evans, Brunt, Baird, Davis, McCann, Feeney, Healy. Subs: Tuffey, Clinghan, Corry Evans, Lafferty, McGinn, Patterson, Gorman. Italy: Viviano, Criscito, Bonucci, Chiellini, Cassani, De Rossi, Pirlo, Mauri, Pepe, Cassano, Borriello. Subs: Sirigu, Marchisio, Bovo, Palombo, Zambrotta, Pazzini, Rossi. Referee: Tony Chapron (France). The teams are out! They wait to take the pitch by the side of the main stand. The features of Italian captain Andrea Pirlo - glamorous, rugged, windswept - look ever so slightly incongruous with the functional metal-blue corrugated-iron wall running behind him. Eventually everyone's let onto the grass. The Italian national anthem is pumped out, a brisk march which can't help positively reeking of the extremely dubious can-do attitudes of the 1930s. The Northern Irish anthem is, of course, that dirge. But there's a rare old atmosphere in this place tonight, and everybody's up for God saving Her. And we're off! Northern Ireland set the ball rolling, playing in their classic green shirts. The azzurri ain't so azzurri, in their away white tops. The ball's quickly gifted to Italy, but Borriello attempts to play keepie-uppie with his hand down the right and that'll be the Irish with the thing again. 2 min: It's a strong start by Italy, though, Cassano bombing down the right and winning a corner. Brunt at the near post heads clear. Northern Ireland have hardly touched the thing yet. 3 min: Pirlo attempts a fancy pirouette and falls over. The crowd enjoy themselves. 4 min: Pirlo, already bossing this, sprays a ball wide right for Pepe on the byline, who hammers it straight at Taylor at the near post. Cassano looks to latch onto the keeper's parry, but Craigan is on hand to hack clear. The hosts are rocking, especially down the Italy right, their left. God alone knows what Jonny Evans is up to. 6 min: Feeney tries to start a little something down the right, but Chiellini blocks the attempt at a cross and any danger is gone. "The Mighty Six don't like to touch the ball very often," explains James Kennedy. "It only exposes technical flaws. This will be a backs to the wall, away-from-home-style 1-0." 9 min: De Rossi, from the middle of his own half, Gerrards a pass straight into the stand behind the goal, with Cassano, Boriello and Pepe all making themselves available across the pitch in the Irish half. 10 min: Now Mauri lumps a long ball straight down the middle. Italy have gone native! 11 min: A nice move from Northern Ireland, this, Healy flicking the ball out to McCann on the left, McCann curling a cross that drops just outside the Italian area. Viviano comes racing from his goal and isn't going to get it, but with Feeney lurking, Chiellini heads purposefully clear. Just for a millisecond, it looked like an opening would develop for the Irish. Just a millisecond, mind. 13 min: Pirlo is really dictating this. He slips a pass down the inside-left channel for Criscito, who has his back to goal on the left-hand edge of the D. He spins on a sixpence, breaks away between McAuley and Craigan, and hammers a cross-cum-shot just wide of the right-hand post. Pepe, bombing into the centre, nearly got onto the end of that to run it home. What superb play by the left back. 15 min: Northern Ireland nearly make a total pig's ear of a free kick 40 yards out, just to the right of goal. They fanny around with some not-particularly-crisp passes, but Brunt salvages the situation by unleashing a low rasper goalwards from silly yards. The ball eventually pings off the back of some poor sod, but I reckon that'd have troubled the keeper had it made it through the gaggle of players on the edge of the area. 17 min: Jonny Evans is having a total shocker. He now sends a blind reverse pass straight to Pepe, who scoots off into the Irish half in acres. He is only spared embarrassment by Pepe's disgraceful attempt to find Cassano in the centre, with the Irish all over the place. 19 min: Under a long ball down the inside-right channel, Chiellini handles on the edge of the area. He's under pressure from Feeney, and he makes a clear move with his right hand to deflect the ball from flying into the box. That's a free kick, surely, possibly even a penalty. But nothing's given at all. 21 min: A couple of mild scares at either end. First Cassano, under a long ball, attempts to poke it goalwards from the left of goal, but can't get anything worthwhile on the ball. Then down the other end, the not especially impressive Viviano flaps under a high hoof into the area. The ball's bundled clear by Bonnucci. 23 min: Mauri nearly releases Pirlo in the area with a tasty volleyed pass down the inside-left channel. Baird toe-pokes behind for a corner, a brilliant interception, for Pirlo would surely have been clear on goal otherwise. The corner's swung into the six-yard box, but with Pepe lurking, Taylor wins a free kick just for being a goalkeeper, as goalkeepers are wont to do. 26 min: Feeney dispossesses Pirlo and sets Davis away on the counter. The Rangers man eats up most of the pitch, before laying off right to Healy on the edge of the area. Healy nudges the ball inside and attempts a curler towards the top-left corner. It just about finds the top-left corner of the stand behind the goal. 29 min: Cassano robs McAuley down the left and nearly breaks into the box. McAuley gets in the way again and hacks the ball out of play. It's either a free kick or a throw to Italy. So naturally the decision goes to Northern Ireland. 31 min: WHAT A DREADFUL MISS BY HEALY!!! From a throw in down the right, Brunt curls a ball to the far post. The ball drops on Healy's head, six yards out. Somehow, the striker heads wide. And it was nearly doubly painful, because... 32 min: WHAT A WONDERFUL SAVE BY TAYLOR!!! Northern Ireland are all over the place at the back as Italy go straight up the other end. A straight lump down the middle sends Borriello clear. He drifts slightly left and hammers a shot towards the bottom right corner. Taylor parries brilliantly. The ball comes out to Cassano, who tries to curl into the top-right corner - but sets the ball out too far wide right, and it's never coming back. 34 min: Pepe goes down in the area while chasing a ball with Jonny Evans, but the full-back wins the ball fairly and buggers off with it. Great defending. 35 min: I can't believe that Healy miss. Dearie me. 37 min: A peach of a pass from Pirlo sets Criscito off down the left. Eventually the ball's shuttled inside to Cassano, who twists and turns and so nearly makes himself shooting space in the box. But no joy, as McAuley, Craigan and Hughes all hover around him. Italy have really been shocked into life by that Healy shambles. 39 min: It's Friday night. I want a pint. 41 min: Another free kick for the Irish, 30-odd yards out, towards the right touchline. McCann stands over it and swings it towards the far post. Hughes gets a boot to it, and hooks it back into the centre. De Rossi, very close to him, blocks the ball - and it comes off his forearm, which was up at head height. That would have been a harsh penalty award - but then I've seen those given. In a parallel universe, Northern Ireland could have had two penalties and a goal tonight. And they've been pretty much outplayed for the entire 41 minutes so far, as well. Strange team, Italy. 44 min: Pirlo sets Cassano free down the left. He reaches the byline, but is held up by McAuley. The striker twists and jinks awhile, then lays the ball back to De Rossi, who unleashes a dangerous-looking low drive that's blocked and then hacked clear. Italy should have made more of that. HALF TIME: Northern Ireland 0-0 Italy. What an odd half of football. How it's ended goalless I'll never know. Italy have looked suspect under high balls. They've only forced Taylor into one desperate save, while Northern Ireland have had two penalty shouts, and Healy should have scored. In the second half, Northern Ireland will have the wind behind them. Expect to see 6'4" galoot Kyle Lafferty at some point. Half-time entertainment: The 1958 World Cup legends Jimmy McIlroy, Harry Gregg, Peter McParland and Billy Bingham wander around the pitch waving, and soaking up the love. Then a nice touch from Chiellini, who high-fives a gaggle of kids - there are about 50 of them - as they swarm around him as he retakes the pitch. He takes his time to slap hands with every one. And we're off again! Italy kick off. Pirlo goes very direct, and sends the ball down the centre for Borriello, who lifts a first-time effort wide left and high. 47 min: Borriello has come out again with renewed vigour. Now he cuts inside from the left and welts a low shot across Taylor and wide right of goal. 48 min: Pirlo tries to score with a free kick from 40 yards. Don't laugh, it nearly went in, dipping towards the bottom-left-hand corner as it completed its flight. 50 min: Cassano releases Pepe down the right. His deep cross to the far post is volleyed over by Mauri. Northern Ireland are rocking at the start of this half. "Chiellini should probably count how many fingers he has left," quips William Peake, proving beyond doubt that the old ones are the best. 52 min: Cassano is seeing a lot of the ball. He cuts inside from the left, reaches the box, and only just fails to find the inrushing De Rossi with a square pass. 55 min: A brilliant run by Feeney down the right. His deep cross is heading straight for McCann's head by the far post, but Cassani eyebrows it behind for a corner before the Irish midfielder can do any damage. From the corner, slapstick stuff as Jonny Evans chases back to recover a loose ball, is upended by an Italian, then penalised for having the ball kicked onto his hand via the back of his head while prone. This referee is hilariously useless. 60 min: Italy are enjoying a lot of the ball, but not doing much with it. Whisper it, but Northern Ireland are two-thirds towards a decent result here. "A few more 'so it is' and 'so they are' would make this whole thing an easier read for us Jim McDonald types, so it would," writes this report's sole remaining reader, William Peake. I can manage one "bout ye" and that's your lot. So I can. 61 min: Italy are playing some lovely stuff straight down the middle. Pirlo rolls a straight pass past a wrong-footed Davis for Mauri, who shuttles a delightful one into the area for Borriello who, left of goal, shoots low and hard straight at Taylor, who snaffles. 63 min: Again Cassani has to eyebrow the ball out of play behind to the left of his goal, Brunt swinging a long ball into the box in the general directon of Healy. The corner's a waste of everyone's time. 64 min: Pirlo sprays a delicious pass out left to Cassano, who romps down the wing, cuts inside, and hacks a terrible shot goalwards with Mauri screaming for the ball in the centre, free on the edge of the area. The ball spins away from danger. Italy really should have done better with that. 66 min: 2006 has called; they want David Healy back. So he's replaced by Kyle Lafferty. 69 min: A corner's earned down the left by Ireland. McCann sends it sailing straight into Viviano's mitts. "Don't worry I am still here," begins James Kennedy. Phew, everyone, eh? "I expect a swarm of Billy come lately Scots and Southerners given their teams woeful showing today to keep you company any minute now." Won't they all be off down the pub to drown their many sorrows, like I/you/everyone should be? "I am eating a Rustlers burger at my desk with a cup of Bovril to try and replicate the Windsor Park feel but it's not quite doing it." You've made the textbook mistake of properly cooking the burger, haven't you? 70 min: Cassano twists and turns down the left. He reaches the box and lays the ball back to Pirlo, who blazes over. That looked for all the world like a goal was coming. A terrible finish by Pirlo. 71 min: Italy are beginning to snatch at their chances now. Pirlo sprays a cross from the left to the far post. Pepe hoicks a shot straight across the front of goal from close range. That's not great. And even worse if it was a cross, which it possibly could have been. If so, he shouldn't have been so bloody craven, and had a dig himself. 72 min: Feeney tries to guide a right-wing cross into the top-right corner with his head. The ball's wide and over, but not that far away. Decent effort. 73 min: Mauri digs a cross out from the byline on the left. Cassano, on the edge of the area, heads an effort towards the top-left corner. Taylor tips over brilliantly. The corner's wasted. Great football all round. Apart from the corner, of course. 75 min: A couple of substitutions I've not mentioned, one for either side. First McGinn replaces Brunt. Then Pazzini comes on for Borriello. 77 min: Pepe crosses four times from the right in less than a minute. Italy are really pushing the Irish back here now. 79 min: Marchisio replaces Mauri, who has been very impressive. "RAI have just said that McCann plays like a non-league player," reports Luca di Giuseppe. "I would have said he reminds me of the style of the disgraceful Simone Pepe." 80 min: Speaking of McCann, Corry Evans replaces him. "Pirlo has been the standout in this game, but so was Beckham when England lost to this lot in 2005," writes Ben Dunn. "The quarterback spraying role seems to be no problem at all for the Northern Irish team with or without Lawrie Sanchez, who wears a suit like a horse wears a stall (copyright R.Chandler 1939)." 82 min: It's Amateur Hour! Northern Ireland win a corner down the right. Davis takes - but kicks the bottom of the flagpost first, sending the flag flying and the ball squirting down the byline. It rests, still in play. Nobody bothers going for it, possibly feeling embarrassment for the hapless Davis. Everyone stands still, looking around confused for a few seconds, then there's a brief flourish of half-arsed challenges, and eventually the referee comes in and awards a drop ball, which is sportingly rolled back to Viviano. This is international football, by the way. 85 min: Luca di Giuseppe will be happy. Pepe is replaced by Rossi. 86 min: WHAT A MISS BY ITALY!!! AND ANOTHER!!! A deep cross from the left. At the far post, from close range, Pazzini heads down into the ground and across the face of goal. It's as though Pepe's never left the field. The ball reaches the far post, where Rossi shanks into the side netting. It's as though Pepe's never left the field. 89 min: What a chance for Davis! He rolls the ball out wide right to McGinn, who rolls the Rangers man back in. Davis romps into the box and hammers a low shot goalwards. Viviano parries round the post. Corner! Davis manages to kick the ball and not the fittings and furnishings this time. There's some nervy defending by the Italians before Bonucci skelps clear. 90 min: There will be three added minutes of this. 90 min +1: Lafferty romps after a long ball down the right. He does all the hard work, keeping the ball in, but immediately miscues it out of play. Italy are looking very nervous. 90 min +2: Italy struggle to clear. Baird has a dig from outside the area, but it's blocked. Italy are clinging on here! FULL TIME: Northern Ireland 0-0 Italy. Italy hold on! A very decent result for the Northern Irish here. "How is it that small countries can so often hold the giants of the game to draws?" wonders Gary Naylor. "If Tooting and Mitcham played the rest of England, they would lose every time and by double figures most likely, so why doesn't it extrapolate up to international level?" It does usually, though, doesn't it? Hungary toasted San Marino 8-0 tonight. It's just Italy, isn't it? They're not very good. The last word to Luca di Giuseppe: "The corner flag affair happened once in my town, in a league match between Civitanovese (plays in Serie D, that equals your Conference) and another team (can't remember, it was ages ago). The difference between the two episodes was that my team's player gets injured and was substituted. He was miles better than the hopeless Simone Pepe." Closedown: Nighty night.

Preamble: Here we go again. Nimble slicksters à gogo, the personification of ah-sure-that'll-doism in goals and a treatment room fuller than Uefa mandarins after a working brunch: yes, there's a distinct sense of déjà vu about Arsenal. That should mean an 11th consecutive appearance in the Champions League knockout stages, and another sorry elimination once the big boys come calling. Or will it really be different this year? Will Arsène Wenger's masterplan/faith/stubbornness/vanity (delete as desired) finally be rewarded with the trophy he most craves, setting the scene for one of the loudest cries of 'I told you so' in the history of football? Teams: Arsenal: Almunia; Sagna, Koscielny, Squillaci, Clichy; Song, Wilshere; Nasri, Fabregas, Arshavin; Chamakh Subs: Fabianksi, Rosicky, Vela, Denilson, Djourou, Eboue, Gibbs Braga: Felipe; Miguel Gaarcia, Moises, Rodriguez, Silvio; Vandinhjo, Aguiar, Hugo Viana; Cesar, Matheus, Alan. Subs: Artur, Paulao, Mossoro, Helder Barbosa, Lima, Andres Madrid, Elton Referee: Alain Hamer (Lux) Humidity: 55% Inevitable result according to Paul the Octopus Hack: Arsenal 3-1 Braga These chaps from Braga: Anyone know anything about them? They looked pretty nifty against Celtic and Sevilla in the previous rounds but how representative were those samples of their overall style and threat? They weren't prolific scorers last season and have been iffy in their domestic championships this term, losing to Porto at the weekend. From what I've seen they're something of a sub-Arsenal, striving to play in a similar way to the Gunners but without quite so much firepower: a sturdy challenge, then, but this a duel Arsenal should win. Shall we say 3-1? 7:35pm: "As a despairing Arsenal fan can you give me a glimmer of hope regarding this year's team?" pleads Gareth Holden. "Surely our players who in the main are all still physically developing should be a better, stronger team and in spite of what people are saying the squad overall looks a lot better then last year. Although it is early doors United and City don't look like title winners, Tottenham don't look great either and although Chelsea have looked imposing, their squad seems lighter then in previous years." I put my money pre-season on Arsenal winning the Premier League and, injuries permitting, I think they still could do that. Chamakh is a great recruit, providing an aerial threat they've hitherto lacked in addition to his fine link-up play, and Koscielny and Vermalen could form a solid partnership. The Champions League is not beyond them but it's difficult seeing them beating Barcelona ... 7:39pm: ITV are showing an interview with Bacary Sagna and he's coming across as an impressive character. He reckons Arsenal have been "too kind" in recent seasons and need to "become bad, in a good way". That could have been written by Jim Steinman. 7:42pm: "In reference to Braga's secret weapon: the semi invisible man: are you sure you're not referring to Almunia?" wonders Sandip Randhawa. "I'm convinced he goes invisible/MIA during vital moments in Arsenal game games." Say, anyone have any suggestions as to who Arsenal should have bought to replace Almunia, for the sort of modest price Wenger would have been prepared to pay (ie, one that excludes the prohibits purchasing the likes of Hugo Lloris). I find it hard to believe Wenger couldn't have found someone better than Mark Schwarzer to pursue. 1 min: Arsenal kick-off to polite applause. 2 min: Hugo Viana puts forward a strong case for a return to the Premier League by crudely clattering Nasri to concede a freekick on half-way. 3 min: It's been a powerful start by Arsenal, who could already have a goal so far. Wilshere showed tremendous tenacity in midfield to win the ball and then slipped a pass through to Arshavin, who fizzed it across the face of goal, fractionally beyond the foot of Chamakh. Fabregas retrieved it on the far side and was then bundled to the ground in the box by Paulo Cesar - the referee ignores pleas for a penalty, no doubt prompting many Englanders to wonder what the heck someone from Luxembourg knows about top-level football. 5 min: Braga break for the first time in the game and provide evidence that they could carry a threat tonight. They streamed forward swiftly and had Arsenal stretched for a moment, though ultimately all they mustered was a wayward long-range shot from Viana. 7 min: Fabregas and Wilshere combine beautifully to slice open the Braga defence. Wilshere slots the ball into the net from 16 yards but the whistle had gone for offside - he looked level to me. 8 min: PENALTY! Fabregas dissected the defence again and Chamakh beat the keeper to it before being tripped. GOAL! Arsenal 1-0 Braga (Fabregas, pen, 9') A perfectly executed penalty by Fabregas flies beyond the reach of Felipe, who dived the right way. That's just reward for Arsenal swashbuckling start. 11 min: Apparently in tonight's programme notes Wenger has called for video evidence to be used to punish bad tackles retrospectively. Read all about it here. 12 min: Unconvincing defending by Arsenal. First both centrebacks headed only weakly away after a Braga freekick and then Clichy dithered on the ball in the box before being robbed by Alan, whose shot was saved by Almunia. 14 min: Arshavin loses the ball in the middle, inviting Braga to hurtle forward anew: they're not at all timid, these chaps. Paulo Cesar lets fly from the edge of the box but it gets a nick off Squillaci to take the power out of it and poses no problem for Almunia. 16 min: Braga try the direct route, seeking out Mateus with a punt up the middle. Koscielny snuffs it out. 18 min: Sagna swings a cross into the centre. Fabregas leaps but succeeds only in nutting Moises, and comes off the worst. After a a wipe with the magic sponge, he clambers back to his feet. The relief around the Emirates is palpable. 20 min: Nasri ghosts down the left but then goofs by passing straight to Vandinho. Braga break afresh but again Paulo Cesar elects to shoot from distance and offers an easy save to Almunia. Either they've convinced that Almunia is plop and will eventually allow one of efforts to trickle past him or they're copping out, firing from way out rather than attempt to pick their way into a more propitious position. 23 min: Arsenal have let their intensity drop in the last few minutes and there are small signs of a braga revival. "Manuel Almunia reminds me of Big Bird in this clip," reveals William Marzouk. 25 min: Aiguar wallops a ridiculous shot into the stands from 28 yards. On an unrelated note, does Song have trouble getting served in pubs? I ask only because I can't think of any other reason why he would die his hair grey, unless he just like that louche, smokey lounge lizard look. 28 min: Freekick to Arsenal outside the box, in shooting range. But Fabregas tries a sneaky pass to Nasri, who had darted into space in anticipation of it. Unfortunately for Arsenal, Silvio had anticipated it too, and he sprung out of the wall to intercept and clear. GOAL! Arsenal 2-0 Braga (Arshavin 30') Made, as ever, by Fabregas, who dribbled past two on the edge of the area and then nudged the ball through to Arshavin, who, coming in from the left, drilled it low past the keeper from 12 yards. Arsenal are on easy street. 32 min: Braga have barely touched the ball since conceding that second goal. Arsenal could win by a bundle here. GOAL! Arsenal 3-0 Braga (Chamakh 34') It's a tippy-tappy triumph! Lots of Arsenal players contributed to that, but the culmination was a splendid improvised flick by Wilshere to Chamakh, who showed nimble feet on the edge of the area before driving low into the bottom corner from 16 yards. 36 min: Arshavin tries to wriggle his way between two defenders at the edge of the area. They refuse to let him through so he falls down in the hope of being offered a penalty. The ref sees sense. 38 min: A slipshod pass by Song in midfield gives Braga the chance to refamiliarise themselves with the ball. They knock it about a bit in their own half before Chamakh, who has shown a fine combination of endeavour and deftness tonight, wins it back for Arsenal, whose dominance resumes. 41 min: This has become embarrassingly easy for Arsenal, who are still managing to look a little ropey on the rare occasions that Braga mount an attack. You can understand Koscielny and Squillaci looking a little hestitant since they've hardly ever played together but there's no excuse for Clichy and Sagna. 43 min: This is dead as a contest. The only reason for continuing to watch is to see whether Arsenal bother creating any more free-form goals or lapse into even shoddier defending. "You can mock Grampa Song all you like but WHAT is THAT on the bonce of Marouane Chamakh?" bays Sean Welch. "He looks like a newborn pony." Half-time: See previous entry. Fabregas and Chamakh have been brilliant, and Wilshere highly promising. "I had a very strong feeling that Aresnal would be able to run up the score today," sobs David Correia. "Braga's first Champions League game and first game in London; that had disaster written all over it!" A grumbler grumbles: "Lets be honest: Man U, Arsenal and Chelsea have rather stroll some groups," carps Michael Aston. "For locals, the only one worth watching is Tottenham's. If I I recall correctly, most feel these group stages are a waste of time, and if Spurs fail (they probably will), then that would only confirm the sad fact, it's a joke. Bring back the home and away knock out games, this is a nonsense.' Perhaps you are being premature: this is Braga's first match in the group stages - remmeber a couple of years agao Bordeaux were walloped 4-0 at Stamford Bridge in their first venture to that stage but they learned quickly and last year reached the quarter-finals. The experience - and the money- gained by Braga could lead to them becoming a more significant European force - they've already shaken up the establishment in Portugal. 46 min: Arsenal win a corner within 45 seconds of the restart. "Of course tomorrow the press will say Chelsea had easy opponents but Arsenal were brilliant - truth is both Zilina and Braga are awful," naysays David Studdert. "Braga may have a billion Brazilians but what they don't have is character, tactics or commitment. Neither game tells us anything about the European chances of either Chelsea or Arsenal." 48 min: Arshavin slips a nice ball into the path of Fabregas at the edge of the Braga area, but Aguiar gets back to seize possession before the Spaniard could get off a shot. "Each to their own and all that, but do Little Cesc and Chamakh shave their arms?" squeals Gary Naylor. "Your slightly San Franciscoish photo suggests that they do." 50 min: A lull. "Half-time and it's 3-0 Arsenal, 0-3 Chelsea and and the knock-out stages are still months away," spurts Justin Kavanagh. "This stage of the Champions League is becoming a bit like those strange "plot bits" at the start of Weird Uncle Fiver's favorite movies, designed to get the "stars" with the best assets all in the same room together. But at least that branch of the entertainment industry doesn't drag it out for hours." GOAL! Arsenal 4-0 Braga (Fabregas 53') That was effortless. Fabregas waltzed past a pair of flimsy tackles and then knocked the ball wide to Arshavin, who hoisted it up to the back post, where Fabregas arrived unattended and nodded into the net from close range. 55 min: Braga substitution for all the good it'll do: Viana off, Mossoro on. "Tell David to relax," warbles Jeff Woodman. "I don't think any Arsenal fans are buying tickets to Wembley based on tonight's game." 57 min: Fabregas denied a hat-trick as the keeper gets a hand to his dink from 15 yards and that gives Moises sufficient time to get back and clear it off the line. "Braga to use this experience as a springboard to greater things?" snorts Gary Naylor. "Yes, but who cares really? We've already got one Rosenborg and that's one too many. Outside the same old names, who's going to win the CL? Citeh in 2016 - so what?" 59 min: That's another bad call from the linesman, who flagged Chamakh for offside when he had clearly timed his run to meet Arshavin's ball well. That would likely have been goal number five. 60 min: Braga change: Mateus off, Lima on. 62 min: Pass, pass, pass, amble, pass, pause, pass, amble, pass, yawn. It really is easy for Arsenal. 64 min: Arsenal changes: Chamakh off, Vela on. Song off, Denilson on. Both the departed have been excellent tonight, especially the Moroccan. 65 min: Sagna booked for a silly foul on Paulo Cesar. 66 min: Braga are nothing but a pile of dinky cars and frisbies to the home side, who are duly toying with them. They nearly struck a fifth goal there, Vela threading a pass through to Arshavin, who drove a low rasper against the butt of the post. GOAL! Arsenal 5-0 Braga (Vela 68') Wilshere to Fabregas to Arshavin, who carries it into the box and then slips the ball through to Vela, whose lifts it over the keeper. 70 min: Arsenal substitution: Arshavin off, Eboue on. 72 min: Nothing of note on the pitch, where Braga have long accepted their fate. "I wonder, Gary Naylor, when exactly was the Champions League/European Cup an open competition that wasn't won by the same old teams?" haws James Wells. "There have been 55 European Cups and Real, Milan, Liverpool, Bayern and Ajax have won over half of them (53%). I'd say Inter, Barca, Man United, etc are the outsiders in this competition, historically." 74 min: Koscielny shows admirable battlign qualities to win the ball in his own half and storm forward to instigate another Arsenal attack, which peters out after a slack Fabregas pass, of all things. 77 min: "This is matador football from Arsenal," opines Clive Tylsdley, who's been providing most of the bull. 78 min: Alan feints his way past Wilshere and then fires in a cross that Almunia grabs ostentatiously. 80 min: The match is now being played at walking pace, albeit Arsenals' walking pace, which is considerably faster than that of most teams, especially Braga's. "So that's now 16-0 to Arsenal when playing Portugese sides in the CL at home, in just four games," counts Chris Dunn. 81 min: Marvellous inventive pass by Wilshere for Fabregas. The keeper charges off his line to turn it behind for a corner, which amounts to nothing. 82 min: Vela tonks one over from 25 yards. "Stop badmouthing Rosenborg," barks Stig Tennas in the direction of Gary Naylor. "They have played the Champions League with 11 Norwegians on the field. How many times have English teams been all English?" Off the top of my head, I'd say never. GOAL! Arsenal 6-0 Braga (Vela 84') No Braga player tracks Fabregas's run from deep and Wilshere duly picks him out with a fine ball over the top. Unselfishly the captain decides against going for his hat-trick and lays the ball up for Vela, who drives into the net from eight yards. "Mr Wells' point is a good one about the narrow range of Big Cup winners," confesses a chastened Gary Naylor. "My only response is a rather feeble one, but it is the truth. It didn't feel as predictable as that nor as it does today." You're right: that was feeble. 87 min: Braga enter the Arsenal box in threatening fashion and ... no, sorry, I was hallucinating. Really Arsenal just tapped the ball around amongst one another for a few minutes while the Portuguese tourists looked puzzled. 89 min: Eboue fouls Barbosa to concede a free in a position from which Braga could, in theory, deliver a dangerous cross. "Same old Arsenal," sniffs Christian Oquendo. "Bully the little kids in elementary school and later in highschool will get slapped by the big boys!" We shall see. 90 mins: It actually was a dangerous, followed by an utterly harmless header from Barbosa. And on that note, the ref puts the Portuguese out of their misery. Full-time: Arsenal outclassed the visitors and had a lot of fun doing so, at times serving up sumptuous football. It's hard to imagine any team beating Braga more emphatically, but still that doesn't tell us whether Arsenal now have the wherewithal to cope with the bigger guns. We'll jsut have to wait and see. Please call again.

9am: Welcome to guardian.co.uk's daily live World Cup blog. Our hope is that this blog will provide all of the following: breaking news, predictions, pontifications, colour from our 13-strong team in South Africa, plus lots of pointing outwards; to your comments below the line, to the best things we've seen on the web, to various World Cup randomania. Our plan is to update the blog from 9am-5pm at weekends, however the posts will come faster between 9am until around midday, when our minute-by-minute reports will kick-in. As there's no point in duplication from that point on, we'll post the best bits of the minute-by-minutes, and bring you updates from our writers in South Africa and fans' networks members across the globe. 9.15am: So, England v Germany, eh? The prevailing opinion around Guardian Towers over the last couple of days seems to have been that England will win, though noboby seems to be able to put their finger on quite why. Paul Hayward has written a piece explaining why it's time to put all the old stereotypes about this fixture behind us, and you can hear the thoughts of the World Cup Daily team here. 9.30am: And here's the Germany perspective from Rafael Honigstein. He reckons England have a real opportunity to get through too. What could possibly go wrong? Right, I'm now going to hand this blog over to its main custodian for the day - Simon Burnton. 9.45am: Ian, The Guardian's page layout czar, arrives in the office a bit miffed. "I thought we were all going to wear red today?" he asks. Nobody else is wearing red. It's the first I've heard of it. 10.00am: You may have read this news story, which we put up last night, about England's handling of the media. You might not have read it. If you haven't, it's quite interesting. 10.18am: An interesting look at this morning's German front pages courtest of our Fans' Network member @JoeWesthead: http://post.ly/kuyS. Lots of them riffing on historical English penalty failures and the comparatively geriatric nature of our first XI. 10.20am: My German's not up to much, but I see that a bit of sunshine is referred to over there as "bratwurstwetter". Isn't any kind of weather bratwurst weather? 10.27am: Good footage on Sky Sports News of Obama watching USA v Ghana yesterday, and not having a clue what the rules are. He assumed that extra time would end after 15 minutes if one of the teams was winning. 10.36am: Nick Collins is already in the stadium for Sky Sports News. He's going to spend about nine hours in that ground today, about six of those with very few other people around. Still, it's a nice backdrop. 10.40am: In other news, Brazil striker Luís Fabiano has revealed a move to Manchester United would be "very attractive". "At 29 I now need to join a club where I can start challenging for the highest honours from the first season," he said. "The choice will come down to Manchester United and Milan. That is the sort of team I want to be signing for, one of the true giants of Europe." The full story will be live on our website in a few minutes. 11.11am: It seems Nick Collins is not alone: The Guardian's Owen Gibson is reporting that the stadium PA is already blaring out the national anthems. Best make sure they've got the right ones, I suppose. 11.22am: Here's an excellent video of the officials warming up for the Chile v Spain game, courtesy of 101greatgoals.com. They're all Mexican, so I suppose they honed their routine at home before bringing it to the world's greatest sporting event. Still, full marks for synchronisation: http://bit.ly/d4bd3d 11.26am: Right, let's have ourselves a little poll, shall we? 11.33am: I'm hearing that England are likely to be unchanged tonight, with Matthew Upson keeping his place ahead of Jamie Carragher. 11.36am: I've got friends in South Africa who bought tickets to Germany v England from Fifa's website on Friday and are currently on a 12-hour road trip to get to Bloemfontein. On which subject, here's Owen Gibson on England fans' travelling tales: http://bit.ly/9uQ1Jb 11.40am: And I don't appear to have linked to Scott Murray's rather diminutive round-up of today's British press: http://bit.ly/amzpbH 11.48am: And in the spirit of reporting absolutely everything anyone at all says about Germany v England, here are the thoughts of Germany's ambassador to Thailand. Well, why not? The English ambassador gave his thoughts in Thai, so they're not good to anyone (who doesn't speak Thai). 11.54am: Not knowing anything at all about astronomy (actually it's astrology – ed), I have no idea if this blogger knows what she's talking about (as in, whether she's making up drivel based on nothing at all, or making up drivel actually inspired in some wacky way by the movements of the planets). But apparently the Saturn/Mars transit means Wayne Rooney's going to have a stinker, and something about Neptune is also bad news for the English. http://bit.ly/9xQ4ad 12.08pm: Here's a video of Italy's squad arriving back home yesterday. Lots of sunglasses, souvenir vuvuzelas and angry fans shouting "vergogna!" – "shame!". http://bit.ly/d4Jw7Z 12.21pm: Nick Asbury has sent in a thing. Is it a poem? A prayer? Dunno. Definitely a thing. Anyway, here it is (and if you really like it, you can download a free poster here): The Nation's Prayer 27:06:10 Our Ashley who Hart and Lennon, Hallowed be Jermain. Ledley Kingdom come, James Milner be done, On earth as it is Glen Johnson. Gerrard this day our Jamie bread, And forgive us our Wright-Phillips, As we Carrick those who Rob Green against us. And lead us not into Matt Upson, But deliver it to Emile. For Wayne is the Lampard, The Crouch and the Terry, Fabio Capello. Our men. 12.23pm: England to name an unchanged side: it's official. Ish. 12.26pm: My poll to see who we want to partner John Terry in the centre of England's defence is implausibly tight after almost 1100 votes - Matthew Upson is on 35.38%, while 35.66% of you think JT is good enough to handle the Germans on his own. Similarly tight at the bottom, with Carragher ahead of Dawson by just six votes. 12.34pm: Another good video, again courtesy of 101greatgoals.com – does Emmanuel Eboué actually Speak Korean (I'm guessing no) or is he taking the mickey? http://bit.ly/9tPAk3 12.48pm: Here are the match predictions of F1 drivers before the European GP in Valencia. From top to bottom, with a bit of guesswork: Bernie Ecclestone (not actually a driver), 1-1; someone I don't know (maybe Jarno Trulli?), 1-1; Timo Glock (who's German), 2-1); Adrian Sutil (also German), 1-0; Lucas di Grassi 0-0; Bruno Senna, 1-3; Jaime Alguersuari, 1-2; Sebastian Vettel (another German), 0-1, Mark Webber (possibly not taking it seriously), 1-5; Rubens Barrichello, 0-3. Overall: Two votes for Germany, five for England and three reckon it's going to penalties. 12.54pm: Fifa have apparently warned their referees to get tough on fouling footballers for the rest of the World Cup. Jorge Larrionda, who will be in charge for Germany v England, sends off players in 70% of his games anyway. It's 2-1 with William Hill on any player being sent off. A banker? 1.03pm: Right, I'm off to see if the butterflies in my stomach are actually just hunger, and can therefore be cured by simply having lunch. Paolo Bandini will be on hand to update the blog if anything big happens while I'm gone. 1.10pm: Hello again. Paolo Bandini back in the chair, but the following Tweet is from Owen Gibson in Bloemfontein: "Fans noisily packing out bars of Waterfront. Chainmail, blow up spitfires, the usual. Germany fans wryly amused, as usual." 1.25pm: Owen may be surrounded with happy fans right now, but the journey to the match has been fraught for some. The following comes from the Associated Press news wire: A small aircraft carrying South African fans to the World Cup match between Germany and England has made an emergency landing on a major highway leading to the host city of Bloemfontein. Police superintendent Sam Makhele said there were no injuries among the six people aboard the plane or in the vehicles on the N1 highway that had to veer out of the plane's way near midday Sunday. Traffic was halted for a while, but Makhele said the highway was reopened after the plane was moved to the side of the road. 1.35pm: And I'm back. My sources on the ground says there are loads of people on the streets of Bloemfontein desperate to sell tickets for the game. If you're less than 90 minutes from there now, which is unlikely because as I understand it nothing is 90 minutes from Bloemfontein, you should be able to get in for face value or below. In my experience (three World Cups, a couple of European championships, all as a fan) this is pretty much unprecedented for any England game, let alone one against Germany. 1.39pm: There might be a few empty seats, but the England fans are out in force... 1.47pm: It's confirmed: England are unchanged. Full teams when I get them. 1.50pm: Incidentally, Sky Sports News' Nick Collins is now about 500 yards from the stadium, with it providing the backdrop to his broadcasts. Given that he was actually inside the stadium three hours ago, it seems he is getting further away from the action the closer it gets. By kick-off he'll be back home. 1.54pm: Australia are all out for 212 after 46 overs in their ODI against England, by the way. Follow Rob Smyth's over-by-over report here: http://bit.ly/cnGLoB 1.55pm: Bastian Schweinsteiger is fit for Germany, with Miroslav Klose returning to the team after suspension. Full teams shortly. 1.59pm: Those teams, then: Germany: Neuer, Lahm, Friedrich, Mertesacker, Boateng, Möller, Khedira, Schweinsteiger, Podolski, Ozil, Klose. England: James, Johnson, Upson, Terry, A Cole, Milner, Lampard, Barry, Gerrard, Defoe, Rooney. Referee: Jorge Larrionda (Uruguay). 2.00pm: This is the first time Fabio Capello has named an unchanged starting line-up for England, fact-fans. 2.01pm: Song of the moment from England's fans in the stadium: "Five-one, even Heskey scored". 2.08pm: In contrast to Italy, here's a report of the return home of another side that went out in the first round: New Zealand (courtesy of Simon Wood). http://bit.ly/bQtSP6 2.12pm: I'll be updating this blog throughout the Germany v England match, incidentally, though Scott Murray will be updating his minute-by-minute report a lot more, I'd have though. 2.13pm: A few pre-match thoughts from Rafael Honigstein: http://bit.ly/duNZDn 2.22pm: Paul Hayward has dropped me an email! Bloemfontein is awash with spare Germany-England tickets. The most likely explanation is that corporate tickets haven't been claimed. At Wembley they would be fetching £1,000 but here a lot of intrepid England fans are getting lucky with late acquisitions. The teams have just dropped on our desks at the Free State Stadium. The rumours were correct. Matthew Upson keeps his place ahead of Jamie Carragher, who was suspended for the Slovenia game. Upson's touch and timing were off in Port Elizabeth but he recovered to make a fine late tackle that helped save England. But it's still a gamble by Fabio Capello not to bring Carragher back. Germany's forwards are bound to go after Upson. 2.29pm: With half an hour to go until kick-off, the results of the who should partner John Terry poll: a total of 1,917 votes and the difference between Matthew Upson in first place and John-Terry-could-beat-'em-on-his-own in second is one vote. 35.52% Upson, 35.47% Terry on his own, 13.88% Ledley King, 8.35% Jamie Carragher and 6.78% poor old Michael Dawson. So, we're with Capello in this one then. 2.31pm: TV presenter and Mrs Frank Lampard Christine Bleakley is at the ground. What happened to the Wag ban? 2.36pm: If you're bored of Hansen and Lineker, here are Miss Germany's pre-match thoughts. Plus: some people running for no apparent reason, and another Miss World contestant holds a beetle and looks unhappy. 2.47pm: I was told some months ago that there was going to be a World Cup fan park somewhere in London, probably Hyde Park or Trafalgar Square. I don't think it actually happened. They've got one in Berlin, though. 2.53pm: Right, I'm proper bricking it. The players are about to come out. I'll keep you abreast of all the key developments over the next couple of hours. Deep breath now. 2.57pm: Anthems sung, hands shaken, obligatory picture of Sepp Blatter in the posh seats broadcast. Nothing to look forward to except the football now. 3.00pm: They're off! 3.09pm: Nervy start for England, and a worryingly good save required from David James when Ozil got a fifth-minute chance. "I'm watching the game on ESPN in Hoboken, NJ," writes Ian Williams. "Steve McManaman and Jürgen Klinsman are the panellists. At the very start of the show they are asked to sum up the significance of the game. Macca jumps in. 'This is so big. I'm sure that I speak for Jurgen here. This is really big. It's D-Day.'" Nice one. 3.19pm: For all the talk about his whistle-happy nature, the referee just awarded his first free-kick. Frank Lampard slammed it into the wall. 3.20pm: GERMANY HAVE SCORED! A TERRIBLE GOAL! A huge punt from the goalkeeper and nobody touches it until Klose pokes it in 10 yards from England's goal. Incredibly soft. 3.23pm: My mind is still boggling about how soft that goal was. When did you last see a goal kick bounce twice before being poked in by a striker? Amazingly poor. Ozil is supposed to be the man with the killer through-balls, not Neuer. 3.25pm: Osil looks depressingly young, a cruel reminder of time's passing. England are looking quite poor, but so is Germany's defence. There's hope here, so long as England don't concede the next goal. 3.31pm: Another great save from James, this time from Klose. That's three times that Germany have worked excellent chances, one of them converted. England haven't been in their penalty area. There's only one team in this. 3.31pm: Having said that, Defoe just hit the bar. He was offside (by a couple of inches), though. 3.33pm: Germany have scored another pathetically easy goal. Klose plays Muller in, Muller passes to Podolski, Podolski shoots low, from a tight angle, under James. Can I go home now? 3.34pm: We're doing OK in the cricket though. 3.35pm: England attack! Very good cross by Milner, Lampard gets on the end of it and the keeper saves very well, to be fair. 3.37pm: ENGLAND GOAL! Short corner from the right, Gerrard crosses and Upson is entirely unmarked to head in from six yards, with the keeper rushing out of his goal helpfully. 3.39pm: ENGLAND SCORE AGAIN! But the linesman doesn't give it! Lampard, from 25 yards, over the keeper, clips the bar, bounces two feet over the line before coming back out. The linesman doesn't give it. Horrendous decision. Disgraceful. Not even close. 3.42pm: England always end their World Cup with a hard luck story. What we can already say, with more than half the game to go, is that the British media will go totally crazy about that decision, and that these officials will not be in charge of another game at this World Cup. 3.47pm: Half-time in Bloemfontein. Lots of booing. The referee, still quaintly ignorant of his own imminent ignominy, trundles off. 3.50pm: An amazing half. Crazily open. Unthinkable that this is the World Cup. The worst goal of the season – Germany's first – and one of the worst refereeing decisions as well. So what's going to happen in the next half? Anything, pretty much. It depends on whether injustice inspires England, or destroys them. 3.54pm: As our very own Daniel Taylor says on Twitter, you didn't need goalline technology to see that was a goal, just a pair of eyes. Luckily, Sepp Blatter in on Twitter himself, @SeppBlatter – I'm sure he'd like to hear your views. 4.01pm: The second half is under way! And William Hill say they will pay out on bets that Lampard would score. 4.02pm: I really have been monitoring the wires pretty assiduously in case a story pops up concerning today's other match, between Argentina and Mexico. It hasn't. 4.03pm: Arne Friedrich is booked, for a pretty basic foul on Jermain Defoe. A pretty weak booking, but then he owes England a bit more than that. 4.09pm: Lampard hits the bar again! This time with a long-range free-kick! No doubt about this one, though – it bounced off the meat of the bar and well clear. Wouldn't be surprised if the referee had given the goal anyway – by now he'll know exactly what happened earlier. 4.12pm: In other news, Raul Albiol's leg injury is less serious than initially feared, and the centre-back could be fit in time to sit on the bench for the remainder of Spain's campaign. He sustained the injury in training yesterday, and will still miss the match against Portugal on Tuesday. 4.15pm: A bad period this, for England. Not because Germany are threatening to extend their lead – although Müller's just had a shot deflected wide from 18 yards – but because they're looking very short of ideas. Steven Gerrard's plan is to score himself – his last four or five touches have ended with poor shots from distance. 4.19pm: The game's opened up again. At one end, Rooney has had a couple of opportunities to play Defoe in, neither of them taken. The first was sent instead to Milner, who blasted at Boateng. The second was just underhit, and intercepted. At the other, Schweinsteiger shoots just wide. Joe Cole comes on for James Milner, who after a poor performance is once again not the answer to England's right-side problem. 4.23pm: According to @OptaJoe, Frank Lampard has now had 37 World Cup shots without scoring – more than anybody in Opta's stat bank going back to 1966, when history officially began. 4.24pm: Germany score! Frank Lampard has a free-kick, 20-odd yards from goal, which somehow ends with Germany scoring. The shot hits the wall, Barry collects the rebound, gives it away and Germany's break ends with Müller thundering the ball home from 15 yards. Nail. Coffin. 4.25pm: Time for plans B, C and D for England. Emile Heskey is warming up. 4.27pm: Germany score a fourth! Another break, Osil skins Barry on the left, draws the one covering defender and squares for Müller to score with ease. 4.29pm: I'm happier for Germany to win 4-1 than 2-1, given Lampard's "goal". The fact remains, though: we have been very well beaten here. Emphatically beaten. Beaten emphatically enough for the "goal" not to matter a jot. But for any England fans who continue to be irate, here's Sepp Blatter's official position on goalline technology: "Fans love to debate any given incident in a game. It is part of the human nature of our sport." 4.31pm: So, another poll then... 4.34pm: If you ask me, the question over Capello isn't "do we have anyone who would do better?", for which the answer may very well be no, but "why are we giving him £6m a year if this is all we're going to get?" Can't we employ Roy Hodgson (or somebody) on a fraction of the salary and give what we save to charity? I'll do it myself, we won't really do any worse and I'd only ask for £3m a year. 4.35pm: My source in the England end says the anti-Capello chants are in full effect. 4.37pm: England in good move shock! It ends with Gerrard's shot being very well saved from 12 yards or so. 4.41pm: Not had enough? Here are Tom Jenkins' best photos from Germany v England: http://bit.ly/daGdRa 4.43pm: I haven't told you about the substitutions that saw Emile Heskey and Shaun Wright-Phillips come on. And I'm not going to now. 4.49pm: It's all over. Germany 4 England 1. Quite an enjoyable, if very one-sided game once I could relax and stop worrying about the possibility of England winning. 4.53pm: The Fabio Capello quitometer is currently surprisingly equal, between "quit now", "fire him first" and "stay". Admittedly, that still means that 72% of voters want shot of him. 4.55pm: The BBC pundits are pretty angry right now. In other news, Manuel Neuer is the first goalkeeper to get a World Cup assist since the USSR's Anzor Kavazashvili in 1966, I'm told. 4.58pm: "What went wrong? We played well at 2-1, 2-2," says Sven-Gora ... er ... Fabio Capello. "After the third goal, there was disappointment for the mistakes we made. We made some mistakes and got caught on the counter-attack. The referee made the bigger mistake." He seemed to think we played quite well. 5.00pm: And here's proof that Lampard's shot shouldn't have counted after all (via reddit.com): http://i.imgur.com/QxJvh.jpg That's all for me. If you want to carry on the conversation, we've opened up the comments on the match report. I imagine it's all going to kick off below the line: http://bit.ly/bwY61u

France's enfeeblement at this World Cup is more chameleon than karma. In Dublin they laugh that Les Bleus are being punished for the double Thierry Henry handball that sent France to South Africa ahead of the Republic of Ireland, but the cause is less faith-based, unless you count Raymond Domenech's astrological leanings. The chameleon Domenech has led this generation into the Seine with his oddball selectorial whims, tactical aberrations and confrontational modus operandi. Blindingly apparent in Thursday's 2-0 defeat to Mexico was that these French players are desperate to reach the end of the Domenech era so they can start afresh under Laurent Blanc, even if that means withdrawing their labour during games. Professional footballers who hoist the white bedsheet while on national service take a grave risk, because the public are seldom inclined to support an insurrection that wrecks a major tournament campaign, but the side led by Patrice Evra have plainly had their fill of the great survivor, Domenench, who held on to the post despite France failing to progress beyond the group phase at Euro 2008. • Follow the Guardian's World Cup team on Twitter • Sign up to play our great Fantasy Football game • Stats centre: Get the lowdown on every player • The latest team-by-team news, features and more The French federation's refusal to act on the coach's deep unpopularity in the dressing room exhibited suicide loyalty. In 2006, in Germany, France drew with Switzerland and South Korea before beating Togo to set off on a winning run that was inspired by the senior players, almost in defiance of their leader. Persuading Zinedine Zidane to return from international retirement proved a masterstroke, but only because it gave the rest of the squad a hero to coalesce around, when the alternative was to quit on the job – which they appear to be doing now. A report now confirmed in reliable sections of the French press is that Domenech tried to make Chelsea's Florent Malouda play in a defensive midfield position in the opening 0-0 draw with Uruguay to allow Yoann Gourcuff freedom to roam. Malouda, arguably the best attacking player in the Premier League after Wayne Rooney last season, objected and was left on the bench. Meanwhile William Gallas expressed his disgust at being overlooked for the captaincy by refusing to talk to the media. France claimed the title of the new Holland: a warring family determined to sabotage their own talent. In theory they could still advance if they beat South Africa and there is a positive result between Uruguay and Mexico but the game is already up, with L'Equipe calling this team "The Impostors" and Zidane diagnosing that Domenech has lost control of the camp. The coach will not have to consult his star signs to know that old pronouncements will be thrown back at him like rotten Brie. Leos, he once said, were "show-offs" who made unreliable defenders. Robert Pires was handicapped by being a Scorpio. Naturally. So for the four years since they lost to Italy on penalties in the 2006 final, French football has been in a race to destruction. The only doubt was who would end up with the bulk of the blame: Domenech or his rebellious players. This mortification will pass, of course, and France will draw on its Clairefontaine academy system to produce new heirs to Zidane, and Blanc will reverse Domenech's folly in leaving Samir Nasri and Karim Benzema at home. This is the end for the William Gallas-Thierry Henry-Nicolas Anelka generation and now Malouda, Nasri, Benzema, Lassana Diarra and Franck Ribéry, if he gets his mind right, will lead France from the mire in the spirit, Blanc will hope, of fraternité.

Tomas Rosicky has been left “devastated” by another injury setback in what could be his final season as an Arsenal player, according to Arsène Wenger. Rosicky sustained a thigh injury against Burnley in the FA Cup and underwent a scan on the problem on Monday, having only come on in the 71st minute during his first match of the campaign. It is the latest blow for the Czech Republic captain, who has suffered numerous injuries since joining the club in 2006, most recently a knee issue. The 35-year-old, who has made 170 appearances in the Premier League over 10 years, is not expected to be offered a new contract at Arsenal when his current deal expires in the summer, meaning his final months at the club could be spent on the sidelines. Wenger did not know how long the midfielder would be out for but it is thought Rosicky – who had not played since June – will miss at least one month. Asked how he sustained the injury, Wenger said: “Nobody understands. I told him straight away after half-time to warm up. I observed him, he’s very conscientious Tomas, he did sprint and sprint, and sprint. He comes on; after three minutes he got the injury. “I looked at him and thought: ‘Tomas you do not run properly’ because he didn’t lift his legs and he lost some balls. I was amazed because he is at the top level technically. He told me after the game that he did it [the injury] straight away. “He warmed up well, for 20 minutes. He’s devastated. Unbelievable. He’s such a good player but his career has been disrupted by so many injuries. He was born in 1980, he’s 35, it’s difficult for him. Let’s hope we have good news, that it is not as bad as feared.” Arsenal play Southampton in the league at the Emirates on Tuesday night, one month after they were comprehensively beaten 4-0 by Ronald Koeman’s side. Other than Rosicky, Wenger will be able to select from a fully fit squad, with Mesut Özil likely to return to the starting lineup after being rested in the Cup. The Arsenal manager blamed the defeat at St Mary’s on a lack of mental focus but said his side’s ability to respond to a disappointing result has improved. “I think the team has a good mentality, a good level of humility and a good togetherness,” he said. “Humility means that you question your performance every time, that you are ready to put a shift in. This team relies a lot on work rate. “Southampton have a good team and let’s not forget they won at Man United, they won at Chelsea, they are a team with quality players like Tadic, Mané, Long, Pellè, Fonte at the back, Wanyama. They are a team with top quality.” “I felt on the day [in December] we did not have the mental energy. We put a lot in. It was Christmas, we always go to Southampton at the Christmas period. We got caught by a team that was full of desire.”

7.23pm: Hello and welcome to live coverage of Manchester City v Leicester City, an FA Cup replay that gives Sven Goran Eriksson the opportunity to revisit the arena in which, for a single season, he dreamed his impossible dreams alongside the wretched Thaksin Shinawatra. Leicester's Silver Fox is back at Eastlands this evening looking to trouble his old employers with the hyper-modern tactical methods that once made him such a prize for the FA's kingmakers ie. hoofing it in to the box from set pieces in the direction of an impressive collection of big men. This is big game for both teams. Roberto Mancini is some way short of earning the right to disrespect the FA Cup like everyone else. Defeat here would be a major setback. For Sven it's all about bouncing back, Partridge-style. I predict goals. 7.30pm: Here are the teams: Man City Hart, Zabaleta, Lescott, Kompany, Kolarov, Toure Yaya, Vieira, Milner, Adam Johnson, Tevez, Silva. Leicester Weale, Naughton, Hobbs, Bamba, Berner, Gallagher, Wellens, Abe, Andy King, Dyer, Howard. So Nervous Joe Hart keeps his place and it's a strong team generally (plus Joleon Lescott). Johnson, Tevez and Silva is a wonderful front three. And the fearsome Bamba will no doubt be a big threat again for Leicester. 7.36pm: Roberto Mancini has just done one of his dead-eye interviews where he just sort of giggles. "We [giggle] know Bamba is good in the air [giggle]." Which is a good thing. Robbie Savage is in the ESPN studio tonight, wearing a preposterous pin-stripe dandy vampire-banker outfit. He looks like a lairy work experience boy at a provincial branch of a major international insurance firm dressed up for the Friday disco trip. 7.41pm: Here come the teams. Carlos Tevez is, as ever, draped in children as he wanders out. Great Dennis the Menace shirts. John Parker wants the benches. Of course: Man City Given, Barry, Jo, Toure, De Jong, Boyata, Nimely. Leicester City Logan, Neilson, Teixeira, Oakley, Waghorn, N'Guessan, Moussa. 7.43pm: Monty writes: "According to my girlfriend her uncle Thaksin is a socialist down-with-the hood, generous old fool who just happens to have a few quid. What's your beef with socialists with poor financial management?" Be very careful. Treat her right. That is all. 1 min City kick off and these two are of course playing for the right to meet Notts County in the 4th round. That won't be enough for Sven of course. He'll be dreaming of at least a semi tonight. 3 mins Leicester have settled quite well here and they look far from over-awed, as well they should, even if their tactics do appear to be based around a back-to-front policy. Dyer gets in a cross towards Howard, he knocks it down King gets on the end of it, having a shot that's deflected over. From the corner Bamba wins the ball but his header is easily caught by Hart. A worrying moment for City - that was the old routine from the first leg. 5 mins Brilliant chance for Johnson though on goal unmarked. Unfortunately he just sort of falls over, after vaguely treading on the ball and Weale saves well. That was a really good chance. What's happened to Johnson. He seems to have stopped going forwards and started instead going backwards. Has he got vertigo? Is he an iffy trainer as Mancini seemed to suggest a while back? I wanted him to be the real thing. 8 mins More good stuff from Leicester. Gallacher has settled well, roving from right to left, and his cross almost forces Lescott to nod it past his own keeper. Hart gathers. And Paul Kenndy asks: "Is Monty suggesting that Thaksin is "not that kind of dictator"?" Chico Tron writes: ""...ie. hoofing it in to the box from set pieces in the direction of an impressive collection of big men." Isn't that the trademark of England's football? Why are you trying to pin that on the Swede?" The Swede is a disciple of Charles Reep, England's greatest hoof professor. Read your history. 11 mins Lovely long diagonal pass by Gallacher finds Dyer in space near goal but he's offside. The Foxes are looking bright. City not so much. Andrew Howe-Ely writes: "Could you please change the photo, Sven staring at me is starting to scare me!" No. Look at Sven. Stare into his eyes. Keep looking. You may not look away. You belong to him. 14 mins Yaya Toure gets into an advanced left channel position and swings in an immediate cross, the kind of cross where commentators say "someone should have been on the end of that", but in fact it was just punted in without really looking. John Millard is currently also wearing a preposterous vampire-banker outfit "What should Savage sport? A Hoxton fin? Should he hang around North London wearing oversized spectacles and trousers that are ridiculously thin in the leg? I don't think provincial is byeword for dressed like a pillock exactly. And yes, I do have a chip on both shoulders. What of it?" 15 mins GOAL! Manchester City 1-0 Leicester City and it's a lovely goal from Tevez, taking the ball down 30 yards out, turning instantly, crashing his way past two defenders and then simply smashing the ball past Weale. Leicester were simply overpowered there. Poor defending from Hobbs and Abe but he really made them pay. 18 mins Tevez was just too hot there and... oh. Hang on. Penalty to Leicester. Vieira tripped Dyer. Definite penalty. 19 mins GOAL! Man City 1-1 Leicester An excellent penalty from Gallacher, sending Hart the wrong way and smashing it low to his left. That was perfectly timed for Leicester. You feared the confidence might drain from them, but Vieira has handed them a way back in. There's plenty more goals in this. 22 mins The place has gone a bit quiet after that, and here comes Dyer again, who's got real pace, and he sprints away from three defenders and has a shot that gets deflected wide. Might have passed there but you can't have everything. Incidentally, Robbie Savage could just wear a really nice suit. That would be a good alternative. 25 mins some sort of handbaggery going on involving Tevez and Wellens and Mark Halsey has a word with both of them. Some finger-wagging there, a little squaring up between two men who could both probably have a fair go at Rugby League. Back down the other end the galloping Toure has a smash at goal from the edge of the penalty area. Weale gathers. And Ian Burch is less keen on uncle Thaksin: "I hardly think Uncle Thaksin was Friedrich Engels during his time in Manchester. While there Engels did give his money away to Karl Marx who was always in need of it while Thaksin had the same relationship with Sven. That's about all they have in common though." 28 mins City have begun to press forward, a bit more rhythm in their passing with Toure seeing a lot of the ball in his galloping role in midfield. I'm never really sure what he's supposed to be doing when he gets the ball. But he does run fast, and usually in a straight line. Gallacher has gone off by the way, with Moussa coming on. Gallacher seems to have pulled something. Not in the Sven sense. Real shame for him as he was playing very well. 31 mins It's all City now, like a suffocating blue cloud. They really are a big strong team, in the same way that Chelsea used to be, but perhaps without the thrust just yet. Or the pace out wide. But definitely with the biceps. Paul Szabo notes: "Thaksin always wore nice suits. No gangster he." 34 mins Leicester are springing forward on the break when they can and they do have plenty of pace. Moussa wins a corner and here comes the wondrous Bamba, but Hart comes out and manages to grab the ball after a bit of a wobble. He points at something or other as if to make out it wasn't his fault. 37 mins GOAL! Manchester City 2-1 Leicester A lovely ball over the top from Milner finds Zabaleta in hectares of space near goal on the left. He plays the ball in to Silva, who shoots, sees his shot saved and Vieira whacks it in. That was too easy. 38 mins GOAL! Manchester City 3-1 Leicester City. Oh I say and that's even easier as Silva plays a sublime pass through the middle for the galloping Johnson, who beats the offside trap with a nicely timed run and then slots easily past Weal. Two moments of high quality from Silva - the shot for Vieira's goal was a deft side-foot - and a nice finish from Johnson and that is surely the game for City. 41 mins So... We've had four goals in 23 minutes. Tevez has just nearly had another. Dyer has just run down the other end and hoofed wildly over the bar. This is a very open game and not what you might have expected from the city of earlier in the season. I like this new galloping, goal-snaffling, chance-giving City. Jim Harris sighs: "Gutted about Gally going off but Franck Moussa is an exciting young prospect for us. Another Belgian to go with the recent Guardian article about young Belgians. With all these Belgians in the Prem now does that render the famous Not The 9 o clock News sketch redundant?" It's not the only thing either. 44 mins Leicester will still make chances here with Dyer sprinting about like an antelope and giving Lescott a terrible time and the neat and skilful Belgian Moussa, who just showed a nice little bit of skill there in the box, looking like he fancies it. Luke Crane yells in the subject line: "Babel going for 7 million, Bent going for a possible 24 million? Has football gone bonkers?" Er. Yes. 45+1 mins HALF TIME Manchester City 3-1 Leicester City and they look well worth it for all the Foxes eager but slightly random thrusts on the break. I'm going to drink a grey hot beverage that will make me feel strangely angry. Back in a moment for more soberly-dressed analysis. Long and slightly deranged from Sean Moore: "As a regular contributor to the MBM's, and a lifelong Evertonian I was dismayed on Sunday to find someone purporting to be me posting a comment during the Spurs Man United game. Either that or I posted in my sleep! Tired and emotional after the injustice of a very dubious penalty decision in the Merseyside derby and a rather fine lunch of lamb and roast potatoes, washed down with a little Pino Grigiot, I decided to have a convalescent snooze, then, fully refreshed, I logged on to check the score, only to find a comment by some impersonator, some ne'er-do-well snake in the grass, and what's worse a Man United fan pretending to be me! It was like something out of 'The Man who Haunted Himself (google it)! Some people have tried to convince me that I'm not the only Sean Moore in the world (apart from that bloke who plays the drums for Manic Street Preachers, obviously), but I'm not convinced. This is identity theft pure and simple, and I won't stand for it. Show yourself sir, that I may expose you for the cad and the vagabond that you clearly are (God, I've come over all Stewart Grainger!)" If you google me you get a picture of me shaking hands with Haddaway. Yes. The Haddaway. Jonny Mac asks: "Is there a story behind the jumping up and down with backs to the pitch routine we just saw?" They saw Lech Poznan doing it in the Europa. They liked it. Plus, jumping up and down together is fun. Looking at the penalty again: it was a little bit soft. But it was still a trip by Vieira, a foot left out that he couldn't get out of the way in time, huge gangly ancient marauding long-legged midfield geriatric superstar that he is. Two great goals for City though: the first was pure power, the second great precision. If they can be bothered, they could get a lot more tonight. Paul Jones writes: "Whilst Sean Moore clearly has several issues to address, more pertinent to me is how exactly the penalty in question from Sunday was in any way dubious? Clearly he became so rattled that he needed a lie down and then proceeded to go mental thinking that someone with his name was posting as him?! Funny to expressly mention that the wine was pinot grigiot as well. Yours, Sean Moore". Yes. Best to keep that bit quiet. Luke Crane asks: "Did Haddaway explain "What is love?" And is it possible?" The answer to that question is here 46 mins Leicester kick us off again and they've brought on Oakley, once of Southampton and a boyhood England star, for a player I have yet to identify. Potentially Wellens. City have got the ball again. They're going to have it a lot for the next 45 minutes. 49 mins Kolarov sprints down the left wing and gets inside his man, but his shot is a weak scuffed swirling thing that flies well wide. On the other wing Johnson and Silva build nicely to get Zabaleta in but the ball goes backwards as City stroll about like a team who can afford to stroll about. 51 mins Tevez runs like a madman into the inside left channel behind Naughton, arms and legs pumping, head bobbing, looking like the most enthusiastic man ever to have been enthusiastic about anything. People do go on about body language in sport, but his body language is incredible. He's the James Joyce of body language. 54 mins Milner waddles forward down the left, twists and turns pleasantly like a slow motion Chris Waddle and lays it off for Tevez to blast a shot over the bar. And Justin Kavanagh has a diagnosis: "I think Sean Moore may be suffering from Black Swan syndrome: for those that haven't seen the film, it's about a ballerina who lands the lead role in Swan Lake and finds herself slowly becoming the evil black swan of ballet's famous dual role. A bit like Señor Tevez becoming an evil sky blue in the eyes of United supporters maybe, or Uncle Sven changing his feathers to become the peacock of Soho Square." Indeed. Like that. 57 mins Berner gets forward nicely on the left for Leicester and crosses the ball. Abe in the middle falls over Milner's outstretched leg and might have had a penalty, but they've already had one slightly soft one and Halsey waves play on. Gary Wraith has been cyber-stalking: "Must say you're in good company when I viewed your Google Search results a moment ago; it's lunchtime in the office here... The Haddaway, different Barney haircuts, a plastic ginger nut being interviewed waffling on about "hearing drums echoing", Sol Campbell, you in a suit with some club colors (which team?) round your neck saluting the hordes, Fabio Capello, Women in Burkhas, some old granny on a dinner table holding a rather large candle (metaphor?), and David Bellamy! Wow..." Bizarre. Just felt my life flash before my eyes. 58 mins Penalty saved by Weal! Tevez won it, cutting inside after a break-out and finding himself tripped by the last man. No red card, and it's Tevez himself who steps up and blasts it straight into Weal's legs as he dives the wrong way. That two misses out of two, and a nice moment for Weal. Will it matter? Perhaps not. 61 mins More nice play from Silva, almost getting Tevez in on goal. You can bet Tevez will run around even more after that. Bet he scores again. Alex Smith writes: "Being a huge Haddaway fan I just googled you and it says you died 15 Feb 2009. Is this mbm coming from beyond the grave?" No. It just reads like that. 64 mins Silva is going off and Barry is coming on. silva has been great this evening. He really does belong in that current generation of brilliant little velcro-touch Spanish midfield gnomes. Steve Burrows writes: "Might there not be a better way to describe Kolarov's position once he has sprinted down the left wing? (49 mins)". You do get some emails like that. Weird isn't it? Why would you bother? The answer is: er, maybe. 68 mins Leicester free-kick in a dangerous position by the right hand edge of the penalty area and Hart comes very confidently to punch away with meaty booming sound. That was just what he needed. Sean Moore is fighting back on Pinot Grigio: "I'll have you and Paul Jones know that I consider myself something of a connoisseur when it comes to matters of the vintner's art and the noble grape. The fact that it was on special offer in Sainsbury's at three bottles for a tenner is merely a minor detail! Sean Moore (nothing to do with the Manic Street Preachers)" 69 mins Howard is off and Waghorn is on. "Michael Garton notes: "I also met Haddaway. It was at a performance in the mid 90s in a provinical shopping centre on the outskirts of Munich. If his career was on the rails back then what state was it in when you met him?" I remember he seemed optimistic at the time. 72 mins Leicester are having a bit of a go and still showing plenty of pace, albeit not that much precision. I like the look of Moussa. He's got some nice moves. And Jim Harris is glad: "Glad Chris Weale saved that. I'll chalk that down to one against the Anti-snood brigade. In fact, surely we should go through automatically for our team not sporting any. Reminds me of, I think it was Alan Curbishly at Charlton, who refused to let any of his players wear gloves unless they were the branded ones available in the club shop." And Leicester have had the ball for about three minutes here. They're not really getting anywhere, but nice possession. 74 mins Leicester free kick 30 yards out and central, blasted goal-wards by the left foot of Waghorn, the ball cannons off a City head with a slightly sickening thud and that's that but much better from Leicester. Matthew Broderick writes: "From a london-living, leicester-mad, science teacher!!give us a shout out!!!especially as we are going to stuff millwall on saturday which is the closest club to my school!!!" Teachers weren't like this in my day. They wore brown jackets and rarely smiled. 76 mins Yellow cards for Dyer and Vieira after some shoving. Nothing much in it. And Mark Ireland writes: "Barney – I don't like to moan (it did take me 51 minutes before I cracked) but both teams in this game are called "City". So when you say… City have got the ball again. Two great goals for City. That is surely the game for City. I do get awfully confused". Really? Some clues: only one City have two goals, so it's probably that one. And it's unlikely to be the game for Leicester City when they're 3-1 down. But yes otherwise I can see that it's confusing. 79 mins Toure walks off very slowly to a standing ovation. Jo, who is a man even though he's called Jo without an "e", comes on. And John Millard is back with the provincial police: ""Provinical" Shopping Centre is it now? I suppose if Haddaway had been playing the Store Rooms, Shoreditch, he'd have been on the up and up? Oh, to hell with it, I need to take the Reliant Robin into Burnley because I've run out of Woodbines." That wasn't me. But then, the answer is probably yes, he would have been. 82 mins Manchester City, who are winning, are toying with Leicester City (who are losing) a bit here, keeping the ball easily and threatening briefly to get Jo in on the edge of the area, but he's ushered away from goal. 83 mins GOAL! Man City 3-2 Leicester City But wait! Berner in midfield plays a one-two off referee Halsey and then threads a lovely pass through to Dyer, who sprints away and finishes very nicely. Leicester deserved that, they haven't stopped running here and Dyer in particular has had a fine game. Still time for another too. 86 mins Johnson buzzes forward and tries to wriggle a way into the Leicester box but he's crowded out and Man City are still keeping the ball better, but Leicester have that pace on the break. They will keep going to the end. And Dennis Johns points out: "I imagine teachers in your day hadn't also played Ferris Bueller, though. Since the not-that-one Sean Moore clarified he wasn't that one, I assume that email was from the actual Matthew Broderick. Tell him I liked Election, and what's he been up to since? If he has become an actual real teacher, that's a bit weird." 89 mins GOAL! Manchester City 4-2 Leicester City This time it's Kolarov as City break the length of the field and the ball is funneled out to the left-back who smacks a beautiful curling shot inside the far post with the outside of his left foot. That's a great strike, lovely bend on it, the kind of shot you dream of hitting but only ever get right about once in a thousand. Unless, maybe, you're a proper footballer. And that's about it then. 90+3 mins FULL TIME Manchester City 4-2 Leicester City Leicester kept going right to the end even after that goal and they've played very well tonight, but Man City just had too much precision in attack and they will play Notts County in the next round. Thanks for your emails and sorry I didn't have time to stick all of them up. That's all from me for now. Good bye. Barney.

Preamble Evening all. West Ham's season has been so ineffective that they can't even fire their manager properly. The rumourmongers down Green Street say that Avram Grant could be "doing one" regardless of the result this evening against Arsenal, although the club today strongly denied that this is the case. Still, it's beginning to look increasingly likely that one of Big Sam Allardici, Marvellous Martin O'Neill or even Roy 'the English Avram Grant' Hodgson could be calling the shots at the Boleyn in the not too distant future. It would be very difficult for messrs Gold and Sullivan to pull the trigger if West Ham were to beat Arsenal this evening, however, and so Grant has one last chance to save his job (in theory at least) having been so inconsiderate to meet or better all the gauntlets they've thrown down to him over the past couple of months, if indeed one can meet or better a gauntlet. I'm not too sure what a gauntlet is. Arsene Wenger on the other hand has said his side will bounce back from their FA Cup draw against Leeds and Carling Cup defeat at Ipswich. But then he would say that, wouldn't he? Scott Parker is missing for West Ham with a twisted ankle sustained in the 2-1 Carling Cup semi-final first-leg win over Birmingham on Wednesday while Frédéric Piquionne is out with the altogether more committed excuse of a sore tooth. Wayne Bridge makes his debut following his loan move from Manchester City. West Ham: Green;, Faubert, Tomkins, Upson, Bridge; Spector, Kovac, Noble, Sears; Cole, Hines. Subs: Boffin, Reid, Gabbidon, Barrera, Boa Morte, McCarthy, Nouble. Arsenal: Szczesny; Eboue, Djourou, Koscielny, Clichy; Song, Wilshere; Walcott, Fabregas, Nasri; Van Persie. Subs: Shea, Vela, Denilson, Arshavin, Gibbs, Chamakh, Bendtner. Referee: Andre Marriner (W Midlands) 5.29pm: Here is the latest Premier League table which shows that West Ham can move out of the relegation zone if they win. That's a big if. "A gauntlet is a kind of glove from medieval armoury," writes Kat Petersen who has visited Wikipedia. "To 'throw down the gauntlet' is to issue a challenge. A gauntlet-wearing knight would challenge a fellow knight or enemy to a duel by throwing one of his gauntlets on the ground. The opponent would pick up the gauntlet to accept the challenge." If West Ham spent more time focusing on matters on the pitch rather than throwing bif metal gloves around the boardroom then they may not be in this mess. 5.30pm: Tony Rowly sees only one outcome today: "Arsenal will probably win today as they look like they are not strong enough to challenge for the title (and West Ham are hopeless). Arsenal tend to get their bad results just after they convince us that maybe they would be capable of winning a trophy, see Wigan, Ipswich, etc." 1 min: Peeeep!!! Andre Marriner blows his whistle and we're underway with Arsenal in yellow playing from left to right. West Ham, as tradition dictates, will play the other way. 2 min: Arsenal win an early corner after stringing about 20 passes together. Eboue crosses from the right and Faubert plays it safe by chesting behind. West Ham look fairly shaky from the set piece but manage to get it away before Fabregas is fouled 30 yards from goal. 3 min: Van Persie's free kick strikes the wall. Arsenal send it back into the penalty area. Van Persie rises and flicks on towards Fabregas but Faubert does really well to hook the ball clear as the Arsenal captain stooped to head at goal. He almost looked like a good defender there. 5 min: West Ham have settled down a bit after spending the opening few minutes chasing shadows. Any time they attack, however, they are immediately swarmed by Arsenal players. 7 min: Another free kick to Arsenal after Mark Noble picked up the ball on the edge of his own area. He had no options, lost the ball and gave away the free. The ball is touched to Nasri whose shot was going well wide but took a big deflection off James Tomkins and landed safely in Robert Green's hands, which seem like an oxymoron but you will have to believe me that it's true. 10 min: Some emails from Rob Bagchi's afternoon Clockwatch ... "If you are going to replace Zola - get someone demonstrably better," writes Geoffrey Saunders. "Grant's record at Pompey was no better than Zola's over the same period - so why choose him? He is an empty suit - useless and did nothing literally nothing at all at Chelsea, as bad at Pompey as Zola was at West Ham; so why pick him in the first place. I hope we go for Hughton. A top man." Meanwhile Tom Shaw says: "What reasoning can there be behind taking over a club, immediately undermining the sitting managar with snide comments in the press, finally sacking him, installing your own man and doing exactly the same to him a few months later when he is one win from safety and has a foot in the final of one of the only three domestic trophies on offer? It makes you wonder how they would run their business interests outside the game if it wasn't for employment laws." 11 min: West Ham look to exploit Arsenal's attacking full backs and Sears flicks a lovely ball over the top to Hines who races on to it, squares across goal but Gael Clichy hacks behind for a corner. Mark Noble's subsequent set-piece is too short and is headed clear at the near post. 13 min: Goal!!! West Ham 0-1 Arsenal (Van Persie) It was such a simple goal and Avram may as well start clearing his desk now. Walcott was in acres of space on the right. He rolled it into the area, Nasri stepped over it, and Van Persie swept it past Green with his right foot. It was a lovely finish but Arsenal had far too much time and space in the build-up. 15 min: Yellow card for Faubert who lunged in on Cesc Fabregas on the far touchline. He's a little bit lucky that the card is only yellow. If Howard Webb was in charge ... West Ham, with the aide of an unconvincing punch from Robert Green, finally scramble it clear. 17 min: "Perhaps West Ham ought to jump on the Messiah bandwagon?" says Tom Shaw. "Surely Ray Winstone or Russell Brand would bring salvation to the Boleyn Ground?" 18 min: It could easily be 2-0 to Arsenal. Walcott beat the offside trap racing onto a long ball. Tomkins did well to hold him up but it rebounded back into Walcott's path but his left foot shot was really weak. 19 min: It's getting worse for West Ham. Mark Noble goes off injured and Luis Boa Morte is on. That's a double blow. "For all his supposed dead ball prowess, can anyone remember the last time Van Persie scored a free kick - not counting the heavily deflected one last week and ones like it?" asks Luke Kelly. "Also, is there a word for a free kick going straight in, equivalent to an ace in tennis" Don't know and No are the answers to those questions. 21 min: Double chance for West Ham to get back into the game. Djourou left his back-pass short and Cole pounced but Szczesny did well to make himself big and block. Boa Morte then picked up the rebound. Hines took it off his toes but blazed his left-footed shot high and wide. 25 min: Nasri then goes straight up the other end and has a scuffed effort that Green saves. This game is all Arsenal. West Ham look a shambles defensively - particularly Bridge who must wish he was back at Man City picking up massive wages for doing nothing. At the same time Cole could well have equalised a moment ago. "Has a manager ever been sacked at half-time? asks Dan Hamilton. "If Gold and Sullivan had some proper style, smart-thinking and showmanship, they'd have the video replay board showing Martin O'Neill running up and down the concourses and practicing his little goal-scoring celebratory jumps." 27 min: More from the questions I don't know the answer to department. "Just wondering if anyone can confirm that Arsenal tradition dictates that the match day captain chooses to wear a long or short sleeve jersey and the rest of the team has to wear the same?" wonders Andrew Martin. Anyone? 27 min: Great saving by Tomkins to stop a certain Arsenal second. It was another swift counter as Fabregas cut in from the left and slid the ball to Van Persie who played it first time into the path of Song who looked certain to score but Tomkins managed to block his effort and the ball skipped neatly into the hands of Robert Green. 30 min: Van Persie should have made it 2-0. He was one-on-one with Green and seemed to wait for his moment but his left-footed effort came back off the inside of the post. "Is it in the MBM contract to say this game is all Arsenal whenever the Guardian is covering them?" wonders Nicholas. "Arsenal have had the better of it but not to the extent you claim. How many more minutes before "pretty football" comes out?" Now that you mention it. Some of Arsenal's football has been very pretty. 33 min: An answer to Andrew Martin's question. "Yes - matchday captain chooses - Tony Adams always chose short sleeves, even in winter," says Stuart Gyseman. Joe Balfour also has all the answers: "In response to Luke Kelly's question for "is there a word for a free kick going straight in, equivalent to an ace in tennis?", the answer is yes. It's called a 'goal'." 35 min: "From the looks of it, Wayne Bridge still is pocketing a massive wage for doing nothing," writes my colleague Alan Gardner. Boom boom. "Re: Van Persie's free kick," says Larry Guinan. It's tough to score from the physio's table." You are all very very funny people. Don't let anyone ever tell you any differently. 38 min: Kovac shepherds the ball out of play not realising the last touch came off Tomkins and Arsenal have a corner. Nasri takes, Tomkins gets a head to it and Kovac then puts it out for a throw. That's teamwork. 40 min: Goal!!! West Ham 0-2 Arsenal (Walcott) It's a deserved second for Arsenal and it's some more great defensive work from Wayne 'just give me my pay cheque and let me get out of here' Bridge. First he played Van Persie onside as the ball was clipped over the top. Then he completely took his eye off Walcott as Van Persie cut the ball back from the byline and it was a fine finish from the winger as he rifled the ball into the roof of the net with his left foot. 42 min: A great chance for Carlton Cole to pull one back - as he had after the first Arsenal goal - but again he fluffs his lines flashing his header wide. It goes for a corner but it should have been in the back of the net. 44 min: "You're getting sacked in the morning," the Arsenal fans are chanting at Avram Grant. Idiots. He's getting sacked in an hour. 45 + 1: This is so easy for Arsenal that Song and Djourou are their two most advanced players and Green is forced to save from the centre back as he burst into the area. The keeper picks up a knock in the process but recovers quickly enough and claims Nasri's resulting corner. Half time: The whistle goes and Arsenal have a deserved two-goal advantage. Grant departs to give what will surely be his final half-time teamtalk as West Ham manager. Martin O'Neill may as well start dusting off those tracksuit bottoms he's been wearing since 1977. Half-time emails I would just like to point out my almost eerie level of prescience in predicting that a team in third place would beat a team at the bottom of the table," gloats Tony Rowly. "Cue Arsenal collapse and 3-2 victory for West Ham." "Wenger has this reputation as a nurturer and developer of talent," says Justin Kirkham, "but I can't help thinking of all the players in recent years who have got noticeably worse whilst under his tutelage: Lehman, Reyes, Eduardo, Arshavin, Rosicky, Van Persie, Diaby, Denilson. Others who certainly aren't improving are Bentner, Vela, Clichy, Walcott. Nasri is about the only current player to justify Wenger's reputation." "Van Persie with this right; Theo with his left - it's all chocolate legs tonight, eh?" says Mike Hatcher. "What a way to run a club," writes Tom Shaw. "Send the manager into a vital relegation match with the prospect of the sack win or lose and still expect the players to give a toss. I've been a West Ham fan for 50 years through good times and bad, but this is the first time I am embarrassed to admit it. It's a joke." 6.33pm:Amir Adhamy has had a productive day. At least up until he started sending emails to the minute-by-minute. "Glad to have made it back home in time for the game, after a 20 mile bike ride which took me to Victoria Park, down the Regents Canal, Canary Wharf (where private security contractors wear police uniform), to Greenwich (god knows), underneath a harbour through a tunnel, and eventually home, knackered. Anyway. Enjoying the Arsenal performance, but feel ever so sorry for Avram. He's got this traumatised, used expression on him, like he's defeated- and the cameraman and VT is exploiting it with repeated cutaways. He looks broken, like a guy who's just found out his fiance knocked boots with the best man, but only found out via text message at the altar. Though, from what I hear of Avram ... [snip - MBM legal department]" 46 min: We're underway in the second half. I predict a passionate West Ham display as tribute to their departing manager and they will draw the second half 1-1. "I can not but help having a great deal of sympathy for Avram Grant," says Graeme Walker. "Rarely do I agree with everything the BBC pundit Mark Lawrenson said on the subject, but today I do. Remind me that for as long as West Ham have this management, I have nothing to do with them." 47 min: Arsenal start the half on the front foot with Van Persie twisting and turning on the right of the penalty area before firing a shot which Green beats away at the near post. Grant has put on his lucky West Ham scarf for the second half. It's a bit late for that. 48 min: It's not just Grant's wots the problem. It's them clowns in the boardroom says Nick Smith in more eloquent language. "Isn't the way that Sullivan &amp; Gold have treat Grant exactly the same as when they ditched Zola, i.e. under-hand and counter productively? How do they think its in anyway, shape or form the right way to manage anything, let alone dignified?" 49 min: The second half is continuing in much the same manner as the first. The hapless Boa Morte lost it 40 yards from goal. Nasri and Wilshere knocked it about for a minute before Van persie fired over from 30 yards. 51 min: Yay! A free kick to West Ham. Boo! Wayne Bridge is going to shoot from 25 yards ... which he does pretty well actually. His shot seemed goalbound until it skimmed off Van Persie's head and went for a corner. So Wayne Bridge has been a constant threat at both ends so far on his West Ham debut. 54 min: Arsenal - pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, Walcott shoot. West Ham - Green save. Justin Kirkham has upset a few. "In response to Justin Kirkham, writes Tony Rowley, " would point out that Van Persie, Eduardo and Diaby have had severe injury problems. Lehmann was at the club for the latter part of his career so was unlikely to improve, Arshavin is clearly not fit and Walcott so far has had a pretty good season. Probably a fair point on Reyes, Denilson, Rosicky and Bendtner though." Chris Hunt says: "I'm sure Patrick Vieira, Thierry Henry, Francesc Fabregas, Jack Wilshere, Ashley Cole (ugh) and even Tony Adams would greatly justify Arsene Wenger's reputation." 56 min: "How many managers have been 2-0 down at half time to a team playing very well and been subject to non-stop speculation from all sides about their imminent sacking?" wonders Roderick Stewart. Grant isn't quite in unchartered territory. Mark Hughes and Martin Jol have effectively been sacked during a game in the last few years. 58 min: Free kick to Arsenal after Boa Morte hauled down Wilshere. Van Persie shoots but it crashes off Matthew Upson's rear end and goes out for a throw. "Will Avram be laughing all the way to the bank?" asks Graeme Walker. "Can anyone remember how long his contract was for? Or are we going to have to have a whip round." 61 min: Some passion from West Ham. That's what it's all about at the end of the day, isn't it? Spector passionately plays it to Sears on the right. The youngster crosses it with so much passion that it veers goalwards where Szczesny, despite being foreign and therefore lacking any passion, still manages to save. 63 min: Freddie Sears comes off and Pablo Barrera comes on. Sears has been one of West Ham's best players. Avram's going out in style. 64 min: West Ham are doing alright at the moment, at least in comparison to the first half. They have the ball, although for many of the players this just forces them to face up to a completely different set of their own limitations than when they are chasing after it. 68 min: Wayne Bridge might have a bit of cramp now which is impeding his performance although, to borrow a phrase from Dorothy Parker, how can they tell? Anyway, Nasri skins him once again and crosses towards Walcott but Tomkins manages to put it behind for a corner. 70 min: There's no pleasing some people. "Any one else get frustrated when Alex Song decides to show his muscle and shield the ball facing his own goal, despite simple side or back passes? " asks Christian Knights. "It seems every week I see him lose the ball in very dangerous areas for what I can see as no reason other than proving his shielding manhood." I'll throw that one to the floor. Speaking of the floor, Carlton Cole is there now having gone over on his ankle. 71 min: In an email headed 'Dorothy Parker' Graeme Walker asks "Who is that?" I'll stick to Only Fools and Horses references from now on. 73 min: Frustration at Alex Song's shielding of the ball seems to have united the world. Or David Penney's part of it at least. "I agree," he writes. "He tried that against Man Utd and got beaten for physicality by Evra for crying out loud." Meanwhile the camera cuts to a series of people who are fast asleep at Upton Park. 75 min: Penalty to Arsenal. Guess who brought down Theo Walcott? That's right. It's Wayne Bridge. 76 min: Goal!!! West Ham 0-3 Arsenal (Van Persie) Robert Green goes the right way but Van Persie's penalty is right in the corner. Cue exodus from Upton Park. 78 min: West Ham's vice-chairwoman Karen Brady is sitting next to The Sun editor Dominic Mohan. Let's hope that he is going to be West Ham's new manager. 79 min: My colleague Jacob Steinberg has just likened Wayne Bridge's debut to Jonathan Woodgate's disastrous first appearance for Real Madrid. At least Woodgate's was for Real Madrid. Arsenal make a change as Fabregas comes off and Denilson comes on. "Denilson on. Clean sheet under threat," says Allan Castle. That's the spirit. 81 min: Emmanuel Eboue has just sauntered into the West ham penalty area like he's lord of the manor. Wayne Bridge disposses him before he can shoot. That'll learn him. 84 min: "Here's a thought," think Craig Smaaskjaer. "Has Avram Grant made more money being sacked than he has from his days in work? Maybe we are the mugs! I wish I could take the credit for this but I heard it on the radio once: "Its no wonder his teams play like they are afraid. Whilst they all arrive at the training ground in Bentleys, their manager arrives upon a Gondola made from skulls." 85 min: "I think I'd like to see Arshavin at this point," says David Penney. "It's players like Bendtner and Denilson who bring him down. He'd relish playing with real players like these." I presume he meant to write "playing against players like these". 88 min: Samir Nasri weaves past three players but Upson manages to block. It's Nasri's last action as he is replaced by Arshavin. Walcott also comes off and Gibbs is on. Wayne Bridge's cramp is going to bring an end to his spectacular evening's work. Frank Nouble comes on. 88 min: From the corner folowing Nasri's effort it comes to Jack Wilshere on the edge of the area. He has so much time its untrue and he shoots left-footed but Green gets down well to his left and pushes it behind. 90 min: "It was comic Sean Lock who made the 'gondola made from skulls' joke about Avram Grant," says Kari Tulinius. What did I say about cultural references? It's Only Fools and Horses or nothing. Three minutes of stoppage time. 90 + 2 min: West Ham are trying to play keep-ball as time runs out on Avram Grant's reign. Carlton Cole is playing mis-control-it-into-touch ball. "No outward signs of defiance [from Grant]," says ESPN's commentator. What's he meant to do? Set fire to his tracksuit? Full time: West Ham 0-3 Arsenal The players trundle off and barely look Grant in the eye as they exit the field. Arsenal move to within two points of leaders Manchester City, although the discrepancy between games played makes the top of the table slightly meaningless reading. West Ham are rooted to the bottom on 20 points and have played more games than any of the bottom nine teams. Grant throws his scarf to the West Ham crowd - or at least the five people who remain in the ground. That pay-off must be huge if he's giving away clothing. 7.33pm: That's it from me. Thanks for all your comments during the game. Sorry I couldn't publish them all. Expect to hear the word 'dignified' a lot over the next few days. I'll leave you with the latest Premier League table after today's games. Bye

---

And so for the £200m men it becomes seven points from a possible 21, and no Premier League win since September. No Mancunians have drawn this often since LS Lowry was in his matchstick prime, and the Eastlands natives are getting decidedly restless, booing City off the pitch at the end of another disappointing performance and deflating result. Seven successive draws, some of them against modest opposition, is hardly the form of top-four wannabes, and it will be interesting to see how much longer the absentee sheikh remains steadfast behind Mark Hughes, whose excuses for his overpaid, underachieving team are wearing a bit thin. "We are still in the mix at the top," he insisted last night, as supporters were ringing the phone-ins to discuss his future. Pressed on the subject, he admitted: "There is pressure for me to get results – every manager has that." In mitigation, Hull were combative throughout, and are impressively transformed from the relegation ragbag who had a moribund look a month ago, since when they have won two and drawn two of their last four. With the advent of a new chairman, Adam Pearson, the embattled Phil Brown has turned things around in the nick of time, and it will not have escaped his attention that this latest restorative result came on the ground at which he experienced his managerial low point last season. It was in the corresponding fixture on Boxing Day that a dreadful first-half performance, which left Hull four goals in arrears, led Brown to admonish his players on the pitch at half-time. The result of his rant? A surly, resentful dressing room gave him two points from the next eight matches, and relegation was averted by a whisker. Fast-forward and, belatedly though it may be, they are playing for him now all right, and it was their indefatigable spirit that enabled Jimmy Bullard to celebrate his return to the starting line-up with a late penalty equaliser. City, as has become their wont, had the initiative throughout, but were frustratingly unable to translate the lion's share of possession and chances into goals. Individually and collectively, Emmanuel Adebayor, Robinho, Carlos Tevez, Shaun Wright-Phillips, Craig Bellamy et al should be doing better against bottom-half opposition. Defensively, too, Hughes has problems. One clean sheet in the past 10 league matches points up the fact that Micah Richards, Joleon Lescott and Wayne Bridge are all operating way below the level that brought them England recognition. Stephen Ireland, Tevez, Robinho and Wright-Phillips all threatened, to no avail, before City took the lead as the first half went into added time. Tevez set up Wright-Phillips, whose shot from 20 yards was deflected into his own net by Anthony Gardner's attempt at a headed clearance. Peskily persistent, Hull would have equalised straight after the interval but for Lescott's goalline clearance from Richard Garcia. The second half followed much the same pattern as the first, with Tevez, Wright-Phillips and Robinho all failing to summon the required accuracy in front of goal, and paying the price late on, when Lescott's foul on Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink enabled Bullard to secure a point from the spot with 10 minutes left. By way of celebration, he imitated Brown's rollicking last season. The Hull manager, in forgiving mood, smiled benignly, then said afterwards: "I'm still in a job because of the sort of spirit the players showed here." Hughes's post-match comments induced a feeling of deja vu: "We have the look of a team that has been put together quickly," he said. "When you do that, you have to keep picking up points, which we are doing. I think the owner understands that." Famous last words? It is not about to get any easier, with Arsenal at home in the League Cup in midweek followed by Chelsea's visit next Saturday. THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT Robert O'Brien, Observer reader It was poor, disjointed, rubbish. Hughes has got to go. He inherited good players and made them worse. Richards was an England player. Now he wouldn't be out of place in the Dog and Duck team. We've got Champions League players and a mid-table manager. Guus Hiddink has got to be available – we've got to make a move for him. The owners are clever; proven players are not doing it for Hughes. He talks about a no-excuse culture but he's got no excuse – he's got to go.

They had more of the game but they never looked like burying us and we were unlucky to concede. We made some changes in the second half that allowed Bullard to roam, and we got more and more confident. The team-talk celebration was superb – that's Bullard all over and Phil Brown's big enough to take it.

How’s Jupp?” Pep Guardiola reportedly asked the first time it was announced he was taking a job from a sixty-something title-winning manager, Bayern Munich’s Jupp Heynckes, in 2013. Whether Manuel Pellegrini was afforded the same consideration remains unclear but there is no doubt the 62-year-old warrants it. “How’s Manuel?” will not have been answered with: “Smashing up his office and sticking pins in a figurine of you.” The manner of the Manchester City manager’s exit, or at least confirmation of it, was in keeping with the “charming man” reputation the Chilean has established during his three seasons at the Etihad Stadium. Pellegrini had finished taking questions about Tuesday’s Premier League trip to Sunderland when, as though a mere footnote, he concluded his press conference with news that 30 June would be his last day after all. “They are not doing anything behind me,” said City’s manager of their deal with Guardiola. “I knew this one month ago.” Then he was up and out of the door, pausing only to confirm the departure date en route. No bitterness, no recrimination, no emotion; just a dignified response from an experienced football man who accepts the business he is in. Pellegrini has been here before, losing his job at the Bernabéu in 2010 owing to the availability of José Mourinho and failure to overhaul Barcelona despite winning Real Madrid’s then-record points total of 96 in a La Liga season. Guardiola again. He had a 75% win ratio in his one season with Real. He will have won more games in his first 100 Premier League fixtures than any manager other than Mourinho, heading to the Stadium of Light with a record of 64 from 99. But self-promotion is not his thing. Pellegrini knew of City’s deal with the two-times Champions League winner at the start of January but said nothing, preferring to focus on keeping the team in four competitions and only raising the subject to avoid further distraction. Having guided City to the Capital One Cup final, the fifth round of the FA Cup, the last 16 of the Champions League and second in the Premier League, three points behind leaders Leicester City, it goes without saying Pellegrini, as his employers’ statement said, “is entirely focused on achieving his targets for the season ahead and retains the respect and commitment of all involved with the leadership of the club”. City will hope the Guardiola effect repeats itself before he sets foot in the door and, as with Heynckes, Pellegrini bows out with a title or three. The impending arrival of one of the finest coaches in the game could concentrate the minds at the City as it did at Bayern but, according to Jürgen Klopp, there was far more to their treble-winning campaign of 2013 than Heynckes’s farewell. Klopp, who suffered more than most from Bayern’s reaction as they beat his Borussia Dortmund team to both the Champions League and Bundesliga title, said: “Maybe [City’s announcement will focus players on silverware], but it is up to the team. Don’t forget, the 2013 treble-winning team of Bayern was unbelievably strong and they had all their players fit until the end. There were other factors too, like them losing a few titles in the years before. Jupp Heynckes and his team worked really good together but they didn’t work well together because he had said he was leaving at the end of the season.” The Liverpool manager believes a mid-season announcement of change can also have a detrimental effect, and admits he considered delaying confirmation of his departure from Dortmund last season for that reason. Klopp said: “I don’t think you can compare City’s situation with mine. I think I announced I was leaving in March [it was 15 April]. I was really close with my team and the whole club. OK, I made the decision but everybody knew about it. I told the players and there was no party afterwards. One player said: ‘OK, let’s enjoy the last few months we have together.’ That’s what we did. “I don’t know how it is inside other clubs but in Germany we use the same phrase as you do here – a lame duck. A lot of people thought it could be like this but it wasn’t for us, thankfully. We didn’t have big success because we didn’t win the cup final but we were completely in the race, completely focused and nothing changed. At the start I had thought about really saying goodbye only on my last day, not before.” Whether Pellegrini resembles Heynckes or a lame duck will be revealed in time but, amid the understandable excitement at City’s coup with Guardiola, his role in the succession should not be overlooked.

There is to be no respite in Chelsea's tumultuous season. Even games that seem to have been won with ease against relegation-threatened opponents are being wrested from the European champions, the sense of farce that is building leaving the interim first-team manager, Rafael Benítez, alone and increasingly exposed amid the maelstrom. Indignity is being delivered on a match-by-match basis at present. The club's hierarchy watched on in disbelief from the directors' box here, Bruce Buck, Ron Gourlay and Michael Emenalo blanching as the visitors caved in to the only two shots of any potency mustered by Reading on the Chelsea goal. That suited trio of chairman, chief executive and technical director have the ominous look of a firing squad about them, as so many previous incumbents have discovered to their cost, and they were grim-faced as they exited amid the locals' giddy delirium on the final whistle. Benítez's position is apparently not under immediate threat, with his side still five points clear of fifth, but this was unacceptable. It was also unexpected. Reading may have come back to score three times in the last eight minutes to beat West Bromwich Albion, but they had looked spent here against a Chelsea side who eased into a two-goal advantage without breaking into a sweat. They were professional rather than spectacular but the hosts were still kept at arm's length until three minutes from time. And then, from a position of complete authority, they disintegrated. Reading's first goal was neatly constructed, the substitute Hope Akpan clipping a neat pass inside Gary Cahill for Adam le Fondre, free of Branislav Ivanovic, to dispatch first time inside Ross Turnbull's near post. Even that should only have been a mild inconvenience, but Chelsea's composure had drained. By the fifth minute of stoppage time, Le Fondre – new to the Premier League but whose reputation as a goal poacher is already well established – was one of three unmarked players at the far post as Adam Federici's free-kick prompted panic. Ivanovic and Cahill allowed the ball to bounce, Jimmy Kébé headed across goal and Akpan flicked on, and there was Le Fondre to volley back and across Turnbull to equalise. Such sloppiness will eat away at Benítez. "Everybody had the same feeling in the dressing-room," said the Spaniard. "Everyone could see the game was under control for us until the last minute. Really disappointing." It says much when 87 minutes of dominance against a team struggling to avoid a swift return to the Championship yields only a point. Benítez pointed to their dominance – and they were so assured – as reason for optimism, and even suggested he could not be angry with his players for their late capitulation given how superior they had been. "If you play bad and draw, you can say it's a problem," he said. "But when you play so well, and have the chances we had … we did a good job, a great game, but we have to manage these little mistakes. We need to get the result we deserve." But, for all that it is only 10 days since they beat Arsenal, their current form has served up draws with Swansea and Brentford prior to this. A fortnight previously they had led Southampton, another of the strugglers, by two at home and only drawn. The hierarchy, via Emenalo, may have impressed upon Benítez the need to finish in the top four and the manager is still on course to achieve just that, but it felt inexcusable not to have squeezed closer to Manchester City in second place once Juan Mata's fine finish from Fernando Torres's perfectly conjured pass had edged the visitors ahead. Add to that Frank Lampard's 196th goal for the club, thumped in from a corner, and a fifth consecutive league away win was surely theirs. Perhaps the sight of Le Fondre entering the fray immediately after that goal should have heightened the Londoners' concentration. Instead, they dawdled and Reading prospered. Brian McDermott's side are out of the relegation zone and showing glimpses of that irrepressible post-Christmas form that has propelled them upwards over the last three years. They had lost only one of their previous seven games in all competitions before this match and, even when their position felt hopeless, retained the conviction that they could eke something from the contest. "We got a draw against the champions of Europe when we were 2-0 down with three minutes to play," said McDermott, through a smile. That summed up the drama. Le Fondre now boasts five goals in his last three Premier League outings, all cameos from the bench. "He's a great bloke, funny and with good banter, and wants to be the best player in training," said the Reading manager. "Our players all have so much more to come: that hunger and desire to improve. We haven't played particularly well tonight but we got something: these guys have so much heart and desire." They retain such energy even into the latter stages. Chelsea are not as effervescent, with this their 41st game of a morale-sapping campaign. Benítez has overseen 20 of those in a little over two months. There simply is no relief to be had at this club.

"This is war," declared Paulo Assunçao. Well, nearly. Saturday night, 10pm. Deportivo de La Coruña versus Valencia and Depor's new signing was pulling on his armour, ready to go into battle. "My team-mates have told me what the rivalry's all about and it's going to be nearly a war," he said. "These games are always hot," agreed the Depor striker Riki. Meanwhile, one headline warned: "The enemy at the gates." By road La Coruña and Valencia are 1,033km apart, 10 hours across the country, northwest corner to east coast, 350km south of the French border, but still: when they meet, it matters. Especially to the Galicians. It all started in 1994, when Deportivo were competing for their first ever league title. Opponents Valencia had nothing to play for – except, it later emerged, a win bonus from Barcelona, 50 million pesetas to be collected at the road-side. Deportivo, the neutral's favourite and universally liked, got a last-minute penalty. Score and they would be champions; miss and … well, it did not bare thinking about. Bebeto did not want to take it; the pressure was huge. Miroslav Djukic did not really want to either but did. He looked absolutely terrified, which was probably because he was absolutely terrified. It was an abysmal penalty. Pathetic, weak. José Luis González Vázquez saved it easily. There should have been something apologetic about it. Instead, the keeper leapt to his feet clenching his fists, a richer man but a poorer man too. At the other end stood Deportivo's goalkeeper Francisco Liaño: "Arrieros somos y en el camino nos encontraremos", he warned. We are muleteers and our paths will cross. They did. When they met in the league the following season, fake bank notes were thrown from the Riazor stands. And then Deportivo beat Valencia in the final of the Copa del Rey – famously played over two days after a hailstorm interrupted play. "That revenge was sweet," Liaño recalled. Meanwhile, something else was starting to happen. Deportivo and Valencia were competing to become the league's other team, genuinely big clubs. Deportivo did win the league in 2000. The previous year, Valencia had won the Copa del Rey. In a six-year spell, between them they won three league titles, two Cups, three Spanish Super Cups and had two Pichichis, plus two runners-up places, two Champions League final appearances and a semi-final, and a Uefa Cup. Deportivo took the Cup off the galácticos on their 100th birthday and in their own stadium; Valencia took the league off them. Twice. Depor and Valencia were the alternative. Real contenders. Were. The last time they met at Riazor, Valencia sent Deportivo down to the second division, two decades later. Another episode in the rivalry perhaps, even if this time there was something apologetic about Valencia's players as they embraced their tearful opponents on the final whistle, but more proof that the days of Super Depor were long gone. This weekend, with Depor having returned to the first division, the same fate hangs over them: Deportivo started the day bottom. Meanwhile, it is coming up to five years since Valencia won anything. Sure, they have been third three years in a row, but each time they were mathematically closer to relegation than the title. In the last seven years, they have won only one trophy between them – and the year that Valencia won the Cup, they spent much of the season fighting the drop. Worse, this weekend they came into their Riazor reencounter in financial trouble, with Deportivo's president in the eye of the storm and Valencia's president taking tranquillisers an hour before kick-off, as he now does every week. Now, that may not sound new. For some time now, Depor's president has talked about a "war economy" and everybody knows that Valencia have two stadiums: one that they cannot afford to finish building and one that they have not been able to sell. Valencia could not even give the stadium away: Bankia had agreed to wipe out the club's €200m debt with them in return for the land but the deal feel through when Bankia itself needed bailing out by the state. But this is new; this time it is worse. Enemy at the gates? More like through the gates, down the hall, into the drawing room and leaning back on a leather arm chair by the fire, swirling a brandy in one hand and holding a huge cigar with the other, lit with a €500 bill, while the building crumbles around them. Just hours before Deportivo and Valencia faced each other on Saturday night, the first conference of the FASFE, the Spanish fans' association linked to Supporters' Direct, closed in Madrid. A survey carried out by the group showed that 96% of Spanish football fans are unhappy with the way that football is run. Over 50% are unhappy at the way their own club is run. Deportivo and Valencia are not alone but their situation has been brought into sharp focus. They have become rivals on the news pages, not just the sports ones. Over the last 10 days, Valencia have been taken over by the local government, who are now looking for a buyer – someone, anyone – and Deportivo have gone into voluntary administration. The same voluntary administration their president, Augusto César Lendoiro, described as a "disgrace" when others did it. Valencia's debt stands at €387m and that is on its way down from the €550m racked up by previous president Juan Soler, football's very own Brian Potter. Deportivo's admitted debt, meanwhile, stands at €93m, their squad and now even their bench occupied by clients of Jorge Mendes. Valencia have been taken over by the regional government – who, having ploughed in more than €110m, also own controlling stakes in Hércules and Elche and sponsored Villarreal via Castellón airport – an airport where no planes have ever taken off or landed – after they defaulted on an interest payment. Deportivo have filed for administration, which – and here's the trick – carries no sporting penalty, after they finally admitted that they could not satisfy their debts and found their income embargoed by the state. They owe money to more than 200 institutions, companies and people. Including €107,000 to a restaurant in La Coruña even though the club owns a restaurant that was granted a Michelin star. Not one of Deportivo's players is up to date on pay and they still owe Albert Luque €2.1m. He left seven years ago. Over at Valencia, David Villa, Juan Mata and David Silva are long gone and continued sales are inevitable, even with a budget that makes the assumption that they will reach next season's Champions League. If they do not, and they currently have Málaga, Betis and Rayo ahead of them, the decomposition will continue at even greater pace. If Deportivo are relegated again, their capacity for generating money will be hit hard: typically a relegated team can expect the money they make from TV rights to drop from €15-20m down to €2m. Amongst the few players for whom Valencia can expect to get good money is Roberto Soldado. But he was missing this weekend through injurey. And even the date and time is not what it was: Saturday night at 10pm used to mean the weekend's biggest game, free-to-air for everyone. No more. Some rivalry. And yet … and yet, on Saturday night, it turned out rather well. To borrow Riki's word, it was "hot". And so was he: he scored twice, the second a beauty, cutting inside from the left. Bernat, coming on in the second half for Valencia, was even better. Or maybe Manuel Pablo was just what Manuel Pablo is: a 36-year-old full-back who can no longer run very fast. Riazor was packed and noisy. There were great saves and lovely touches – one gorgeous bit of ball control from Ever Banega sticks in the mind. There was a goal in the first minute, a goal in the last minute, and five over all. Valencia took the lead, Deportivo took it back, Valencia equalised. And then in the 92nd minute, Ricardo Costa scored the winner. 3-2 to Valencia. Depor slipped to four points from safety; four points from their original rivals, Celta de Vigo. "Valencia again," lamented one headline. When the goal went in Deportivo's players crumpled to the floor; soon one of Valencia's did. By then, Depor were down to 10 men. From the kick-off, they were down to nine. It turns out that Assunçao was right; he took his team-mates' word for it. His first game, his first red card. "Almost a war." The game resolved, defeat confirmed, the ball in Deportivo's possession, he was sent off for clothes-lining Nelson Valdez. Just for old time's sake. Talking points • Oh, Leo, you sneaky little cheat. Another day, another phone call. "How many this week, Ron?" "Three?" "OK, then." And so it was that Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat-trick for Real Madrid as they defeated Getafe 4-0 at the Bernabéu, before making way for a substitute, job done. And so it was that Leo Messi scored a hat-trick for Barcelona. Only he did not make way. Instead, the cheeky scamp stayed on the pitch … and scored a fourth. This week they meet again (yes, again). It's the Copa del Rey semi-final first leg at the Bernabéu. Barcelona meet Madrid for the fourth time this season with two more games guaranteed. And, Champions League permitting, maybe two more on top of that (By the way: the second leg, in another demonstration of organisational genius, is not for a month). • Dear Atlético Madrid fans: sorry about that. They lost 3-0 at Athletic Bilbao. It was probably the best Athletic have played all season. Fast, open, direct. And capped off with a brilliant counter-attacking goal, sweeping from one penalty area to the other. • Dear Betis fans: sorry about that. Gah. Betis have a brilliant season, play lovely football under a fascinating coach and climb into a Champions League place. Perfect. Only, it is not. Not quite. First, they stick them on a bloody Monday, too late. But not to worry because then they head to Madrid; the team with the best away record in the league after Barcelona. This column gets all excited and goes to watch them, to talk to them, and to write all about them and how bloody good they are. So what happens? They get hammered, of course. Mind you, Rayo were superb again: it finished 3-0 and Delibasic's goal might even be the best so far this season, played out only metres away. Betis had two memorable shots: one which cracked a team-mate in the head and one which sailed over the bar … and over the wall at the end of the ground. Yes, this wall. • Mallorca used to attack a little and win a lot. This weekend they attacked a lot – 23 shots to Málaga's five – and lost. Joaquín Caparrós (Dear Mallorca fans, etc and so on) may not hold on to his job very much longer. Results: Celta 1-1 Real Sociedad, Levante 2-1 Valladolid, Zaragoza 0-0 Espanyol, Deportivo 2-3 Valencia, Real Madrid 4-0 Getafe, Rayo 3-0 Betis, Barcelona 5-1 Osasuna, Athletic 3-0 Atlético, Mallorca 2-3 Málaga. Tonight's game: Sevilla-Granada. • Latest La Liga standings

Daniele Portanova still had to show up to work every day. Handed a four-month suspension this summer for 'omessa denuncia' – the failure to report attempted match-fixing – Portanova nevertheless continued to train with his team-mates. He still ran when they ran, stretched when they stretched, and chased Alessandro Diamanti's shadow in defensive drills. Portanova continued to perform all of his typical duties, except for the only one that really matters. "It was undoubtedly a strange sensation," said the Bologna defender on Wednesday. "You train as usual during the week, but you don't get the adrenaline you are used to." A 33-year-old journeyman with eight clubs on his resumé, Portanova had appeared in more than 400 games as a professional and served as Bologna's club captain prior to his suspension. Yet the prospect of returning to action on Sunday, against one of those former employers – Napoli – made him as nervous as he had felt prior to his first appearance for Fermana, in what was then Serie C1, back in 1998. "I am so emotional; it feels like this is my first day again," he said as the team prepared for their trip to Naples. "I have been waiting for this moment and now it has arrived. It is like I have gone back to my professional debut." Some spot this would have been for a defender truly making their bow. Napoli's attack, led by Edinson Cavani, had scored 19 goals in their previous eight games at the Stadio San Paolo. They arrived at this game with the added incentive of knowing that a victory would move them up to second in the Serie A table, after Internazionale had lost to Lazio the day before. Bologna, by contrast, were struggling at the wrong end of the table. Through 16 games they had collected only 15 points – and only three of those on their travels. Portanova's absence had been felt, but this team would not have expected drastically different results with him present. Bologna's sights were set first and foremost on maintaining top-flight status. On Sunday, though, they had their hosts troubled from the outset. The manager Stefano Pioli's decision to modify the Christmas tree formation used in recent games into a 4-2-3-1 was a resounding success, Bologna suffocating Napoli in midfield, keeping the ball away from Cavani and his forward partner Lorenzo Insigne. After 10 minutes, Bologna took the lead, Manolo Gabbiadini bundling home a cross from Nicolò Cherubin. Alberto Gilardino had the ball in the net for them again less than a quarter of an hour later, only for his header to be wrongly disallowed for offside. At that stage Napoli were reeling, yet there was a sense of inevitability about their equaliser just after half-time. Federico Agliardi attempted to palm away a near-post shot but instead pushed it straight into the path of the onrushing Alessandro Gamberini. Pioli had altered his team's shape, withdrawing Tiberio Guarente and introducing Archimede Morleo, and somewhere along the way, attacking impetus was lost. In the 70th minute, Napoli took the lead, through Cavani's close-range header. Now the script seemed set: this was to be another come-from-behind victory for a team whyo have built a reputation for scoring late goals under Walter Mazzarri. But that was before Panagiotis Kone intervened. A second-half replacement for René Krhin, Kone's volleyed equaliser from a horizontal position will go down as one of the goals as the season. Less than five minutes remained when Kone struck, and yet his goal did not represent the culmination of the drama. That would arrive just a few moments later, when Portanova himself arrived with the winner, timing his run into the box perfectly to meet an Alessandro Diamanti free-kick from the left. "This goal repaid me for a cruel page in the history of football, written at my expense," said Portanova afterwards. He maintained his innocence throughout the process, stating that he did not even understand what he was being asked when two associates of the former Bari defender Andrea Masiello allegedly approached him for help fixing a game between that team and Bologna on the final day of the 2010-11 season. Bari won the game 4-0. The verdict delivered by the Italian Football Federation's disciplinary committee did not find Portanova guilty of agreeing to throw the match but only of failing to report that conversation. "Omessa denuncia is a delicate thing," he observed at his press conference last week. "This had never happened to me before, I was a bit drunk too. I paid a dear price for that meeting. The ban only lasted four months but for me it was a lifetime." Yet where Bologna were strengthened on Sunday by Portanova's return, Napoli's preparations had been overshadowed by impending charges against two of their own players. Last week the federation's prosecutor, Stefano Palazzi, requested that Paolo Cannavaro and Gianluca Grava each be suspended for nine months for their alleged failure to report an attempted fix of a game against Sampdoria in May 2010. Palazzi also requested that Napoli be docked one point. The disciplinary committee is expected to deliver a verdict on Monday. Should it find the players guilty, it does not necessarily have to accept Palazzi's suggested punishments. It has been widely anticipated in the Italian press that the players would instead be handed six-month bans, and Napoli given a two-point penalty. Any ruling would be subject to appeal, and both Cannavaro and Grava have maintained their innocence. Mazzarri asked only that people reserve judgment until due process is complete. "There are trials going on in the papers every day," he said when asked if his players' performance had been affected. "The team has been subjected to a bombardment and I don't know what's going on in the lads' heads. I would like these trials to be conducted in the proper chambers." Much as the impending verdict will be on his mind, Mazzarri is aware that he must also resolve the problems that saw his team throw away an 85th-minute lead at home to a team lingering near the bottom of the table, even with Cannavaro available to perform his usual duties. Talking points • Parma celebrated their 99th birthday on Sunday with an emphatic 4-1 win over Cagliari. Kevin-Prince Boateng celebrated Milan's 113th by posting a video of himself as a dancing elf on Twitter. • Milan had an identical 4-1 victory to savour. They have now won four straight and sit only six points outside the Champions League places. Antonio Nocerino, scorer of the game's opening goal, dedicated his strike to the victims of Friday's school shooting in Connecticut. "My thoughts are exclusively with them," he said. • David Pizarro had a personal tragedy on his mind as he returned to the field for the first time since the death of his sister. The midfielder was greeted at the Stadio Artemio Franchi by a pair of Spanish-language banners prepared by the home support, which read: "Pek we are with you, in a heart-felt embrace". Pizarro scored Fiorentina's second goal from the penalty spot as they too triumphed 4-1, over Siena. He pointed to the sky in celebration, before falling to his knees. "He is a great player and an even greater man," said Fiorentina's manager Vincenzo Montella. • Siena responded to defeat by sacking their manager Serse Cosmi. The Robur are rooted to the bottom of the table, though that is somewhat misleading as an indicator of Cosmi's performance. Were it not for a six-point penalty handed down as a result of the summer match-fixing investigations, they would be 14th. • Zdenek Zeman refused to speak to the press after Roma's run of five consecutive wins ended with a 1-0 defeat to Chievo. The general manager, Franco Baldini, suggested that Zeman had been unhappy with certain refereeing decisions. There was a suspicion of offside about Sergio Pellissier's 87th-minute winner, though under heavy fog you could hardly blame the officials for being uncertain. • Juve's win over Atalanta, combined with defeats for Inter and Napoli, sealed the Bianconeri's status as Winter Champions. But Antonio Conte played down newspaper reports that the team would attempt to sign Didier Drogba in the January transfer window. "There will be no top player in January," he said. Results: Catania 3-1 Sampdoria, Chievo 1-0 Roma, Fiorentina 4-1 Siena, Genoa 1-1 Torino, Juventus 3-0 Atalanta, Lazio 1-0 Internazionale, Milan 4-1 Pescara, Napoli 2-3 Bologna, Parma 4-1 Cagliari, Udinese 1-1 Palermo. • The latest Serie A standings

It was approaching a quarter to three on Wednesday morning when Roberto Di Matteo, clad in a club suit and lost in his thoughts, shuffled through Gatwick's south terminal towards the waiting team bus. A gaggle of fans and airport staff asked for photographs in arrivals and were duly obliged, but the Italian managed barely a flicker of a smile on the images that were captured. Even then, he must have guessed what was to follow. Within hours his desk down at Cobham would be cleared, the manager who had claimed Chelsea's first European Cup almost six months to the day jettisoned and confirmation delivered in that formal 186-word online statement that feels like a template. Recent results, which had yielded two wins in eight matches, had "not been good enough". The "owner and the board" felt a change was necessary "to keep the club moving in the right direction". "We will never forget the huge contribution [Di Matteo] has made to this club's history and he will always be welcome at Stamford Bridge," where he will be able presumably to sit alongside Carlo Ancelotti, José Mourinho or Avram Grant as managers who have been "reluctantly" axed. This all feels depressingly familiar. The chairman, Bruce Buck, and the chief executive, Ron Gourlay, had sat in the middle of the plane en route back from Italy, separate from the coaching staff at the front, and had made their own way back to the training ground where the sacking was confirmed. The hierarchy did have valid concerns over the side's recent form. If the initial defeat to Manchester United in the Premier League had felt freakish – with two players sent off just after the hosts clawed themselves level, and a Javier Hernández winner scored from an offside position – then it was shocking how rapidly the team unravelled thereafter. Defeat at West Bromwich Albion on Saturday stretched the winless league sequence to four games. The humiliation in Turin on Tuesday has effectively wrecked the defence of the European Cup, the holders defensively shambolic and with Di Matteo's decision to omit Fernando Torres from his starting lineup politically sensitive. Had they picked up the point they required at Juventus to keep their destiny in their own hands, then sidelining the misfiring Spaniard – who has registered one goal since the first week of October – might have felt like a masterstroke. Yet in the wake of such a miserable loss it could easily, if wrongly, be seen as Di Matteo's Ruud Gullit moment. For Torres, read Alan Shearer against Sunderland in the deluge at St James' Park in 1999. Torres's form at Chelsea does not merit the comparison, but he was supposed to be the fulcrum around which this team was built post Didier Drogba. Leaving him out could be perceived as an admission of defeat, even if the outgoing manager should take some satisfaction that he had the guts to drop the favourite. Others would merely have toed the party line and persisted. There was a dignity to Di Matteo's exit. He had accepted responsibility for Tuesday night's hammering in Italy. "If anyone's to blame, it is me," he had said, even if his team's defending deserved more scrutiny, and he will retreat back on to the job queue as a European Cup winner; in the summer of 2011, when he had accompanied André Villas-Boas to Stamford Bridge, he felt more like a failed West Brom manager. He deserved better than this, though the reality that he was never first choice to take up the reins permanently last summer had always left him in a glorified caretaker role. There had been no immediate award of a permanent deal after Munich. The two-year contract, complete with break clause, was only agreed in June when it became clear Pep Guardiola would not give up on his idea of a year-long sabbatical. So, as second choice, results such as the 4-1 drubbing in the European Super Cup in August took on greater resonance. That trophy felt like an irrelevance crammed into the schedule on the night the transfer window closed, when Chelsea might have been better occupied adding a defensive midfielder or second forward to their ranks, but Roman Abramovich wanted it won. Being embarrassed by Radamel Falcao, a player who would surely have flourished at Stamford Bridge, was unacceptable and, as a result, the beginning of the end. There is already a sense of trepidation, bordering on outrage, among supporters at the prospect of Rafael Benítez taking up the reins even short-term now, and it is incongruous that the former Liverpool manager may consider joining Chelsea as an opportunity to restore his reputation after two years out. Di Matteo was the eighth head coach to oversee the team at Chelsea over Abramovich's 10 seasons, and only Ancelotti has managed to see out a full season since Mourinho departed in the September of 2007. Guardiola remains the long-term target but may look again at that revolving door and wonder whether all this farce is for him. "Roberto helped guide us to an historic Champions League victory and a seventh FA Cup," concluded the club's statement, and yet that was still not enough. This job is a hiding to a huge pay-off.

OH FERNANDO! In any organisation, group or team, there's always one slacker who doesn't bring quite as much to the table as everybody else. At the offices of the J Peterman catalogue, for example, the Sidler never lifted a finger, utilising his uncanny knack of moving around silently to offload all of his work on to poor Elaine Benes. In ersatz Buddy Holly tribute act Beatles Band, three of the members spent an entire decade penning a series of increasingly complex songs while the other just sat at the back repeatedly hitting his ride cymbal four to the floor and developing a fancy for booze. And then, perhaps most disgracefully of all, on the Guardian sports des … hold on … at Chelsea Football Club, Fernando Torres has, while his team-mates put in all the hard yards, been strolling around with a face on since joining the club in January 2011, achieving the sum total of nothing, and arguably even less. At least Ringo swung like a mother on those early singles, got to trill the lead vocal on Yellow Submarine, and developed a fancy for booze. Torres, by comparison, will have even fewer personal achievements to look back on in his dotage than Pete Best. Because that 2012 haul of FA Cup, Big Cup and European Championship medals is fooling nobody, least of all – one suspects – if the pained look permanently plastered across his coupon is anything to go by, the player himself. And you have to admit it doesn't look like it's getting better any time soon for Po' Nando. Tonight his stock will crash to a new low, as reports suggest he's going to be dropped for Chelsea's visit to Juventus in favour of Eden Hazard. A £50m striker not trusted to do the business in a crucial Big Cup game: as Ringo once harmonised, it can't get no worse. It could, of course; they could have really added insult to injury by replacing him with Daniel Sturridge instead. But the general point stands. This is all in many ways immaterial, for the real big game tonight is being played elsewhere. Not in Istanbul, where a Manchester United representative XI are f@nnying around against Galatasaray, but in Lisbon, where the Queen's Celtic once won Big Cup back in the days when the competition wasn't just about money. (Ask your parents, pop kids.) Neil Lennon's side are coming off the back of that win against Barcelona, the Best Side Over The Brow Of The Hill In The World, and can reach the second round with victory. Much may depend on which Victor Wanyama turns up – the brilliant but understandably inconsistent young man who has occasionally looked like a less-mobile wardrobe in the SPL, or the all-conquering version invented by English journalists who clapped eyes on him for the first time during the highlights programme after the win over Barca – and whether captain Scott Brown passes a fitness test. Lennon will no doubt be evoking the memory of the Lisbon Lions before sending his team out tonight, having noted that "1967 is a pivotal day in our history".

Arsène Wenger "was not surprised" to hear of Sir Alex Ferguson's decision to retire as manager of Manchester United and suggested he knew the Scot would quit at the end of this season when United decided to sign Robin van Persie from Arsenal last summer. Speaking for the first time since his long-time adversary announced his decision to step away from management following 27, trophy-laden years at Old Trafford, Wenger said: "I was not surprised and I told my staff a long time ago that I think it will be Alex Ferguson's last year. I detected a few signs through the season – there was already one of them before the season started, that it could be his final year." The Frenchman was then asked if Ferguson's retirement was discussed during the negotiations that led to Van Persie's £24m transfer last August and, after smiling coyly, he replied: "I wouldn't like to come back on that. I will let you know one day." That answer pointed towards the "sign" Wenger had seen, with regard to Ferguson's retirement, prior to the start of this campaign. The deal certainly raised some eyebrows at the time given the expensive capture of a 29-year-old went against United's policy of not spending a significant amount of money on players in the final stages of their career. Ferguson, Wenger may have been suggesting, pursued the deal as part of a short-term plan to regain the Premier League title from Manchester City before he walked away. Wenger also praised Ferguson for his "remarkable career" at United but expressed concerns that having been involved in football for such a long time, the 71-year-old may find life away from the spotlight difficult to adjust to. "There is a double challenge now," he said. "The first is for Manchester United to replace a guy of that stature, and the second challenge for Alex Ferguson is to have a life as passionate and as interesting as the life he had until now. "He is luckier than me because he likes horses, he likes golf, so he can certainly have an interesting life again. But of course when you have been such a long time involved in every [game] … our job is always looking forward to the next game, so you are always motivated by that. At the start it is difficult to miss that." He added: "But after 26 years, he just won the championship, he knows it will be more difficult even for Man United to have that consistency now because there are so many teams who have financial power. You have to respect his decision."

Both sides go into the match with their destinies for this Premier League season all but sewn up. Sixth-placed Everton are five points ahead of local rivals Liverpool and have pretty much given up hope of climbing higher and qualifying for the Champions League, after defeat to a rejuvenated Sunderland side last weekend. Fulham, meanwhile, occupy a comfortable position in midtable having not won any of their last four games and travel to a ground where they have never been victorious in the league.

Paolo Di Canio apologised to the Sunderland supporters and described his team's performance as "unacceptable", after they crashed to a 6-1 defeat against a rampant Aston Villa side inspired by Christian Benteke. The Villa striker scored a second-half hat-trick to lift the Midlands club five points clear of the relegation zone, above Newcastle on goal difference and level on points with Sunderland, who are back in trouble again after this crushing defeat. Di Canio, who branded the result "humiliating", made a point of going over to the Sunderland supporters at the final whistle to say sorry. To compound Sunderland's misery, they finished the game with 10 men after Stéphane Sessègnon received a straight red card for a clumsy, rather than reckless, challenge on Yacouba Sylla. Di Canio felt that the dismissal was harsh and said that Sunderland would be appealing against a decision that brings an automatic three-match ban, ruling the forward out for the rest of the season. The Sunderland manager's main concern, however, was the manner of this defeat. Sunderland were a shambles defensively, unable to handle Benteke, whom Paul Lambert, the Villa manager, described as "world-class" after the Belgium international took his tally for the season to 22 with three predatory goals. "It's not acceptable, it's obvious there were two different teams on the field," Di Canio said. "One team, Aston Villa, with a ferocity, with desire, ambition and dedication, like it was the last chance of their life. In some ways, they looked like us in the last few weeks. It's obvious this can happen once in football but it's not acceptable. "I know it probably can happen because [after] two wins in a row the stomach is a bit full; they gave everything the last two weeks but we can do much better. Sometimes when you eat a lot you relax or you sleep but you need more food to be alive and we need three more points minimum." Di Canio acknowledged that the fans were entitled to feel badly let down. "Obviously we have to apologise to all of our environment because we have a big responsibility. We have to make sure this week we are going to work like we did in the last few weeks with the blood in our eyes and make sure we are going to treat the next game like it is the last game of the season and we need three points. Maybe now we need four or five points. "When I was a footballer I did the same [apologised to the supporters]. It's beautiful to go there when you celebrate, when you win against Newcastle and Everton, but you have to make sure you stand in front of everybody when you lose and when you lose heavy like this." Di Canio said he is hopeful that Sessègnon's red card will be overturned. "There is nothing. His sole [of his boot] obviously finishes in Sylla's foot but the leg is not straight. He didn't want to cause any damage to his opponent at all. For sure we are going to appeal." For Villa this superb victory was the shot in the arm they badly needed going into the final few games of the season. Lambert was effusive in his praise of his players, singling out Matthew Lowton, who set up Villa's second goal with a majestic pass, as "the best player on the pitch by a mile" and applauding Benteke's remarkable contribution in his first season in English football. "As long as [Benteke] keeps his hunger for the game, he can have a big career," the Villa manager said. "People tend to forget he's only young. I've just seen his [second] goal from [Ashley Westwood's] corner and he's jumped as high as the crossbar. He was excellent. His technique for a big lad is fabulous." As for the bigger picture, Villa have given themselves every chance of surviving with a display that electrified the home supporters. "First and foremost, the most important thing was to win a high-pressure game," Lambert said. "The way we played was outstanding. Right from the off we were fantastic. I always think you can judge a team's performance by a crowd and tonight the whole place was absolutely rocking."

Brendan Rodgers in his time as Liverpool manager has developed a reputation for making grand statements, yet the one he delivered after this game seemed appropriate. Asked if he felt Alex McCarthy's display for Reading was the best he had seen by a goalkeeper, Rodgers was in no doubt. "I can't remember being at a game where a goalkeeper has performed like that, either as a manager, coach or spectator," he said. "He was brilliant." McCarthy's showing did not surprise Rodgers. He was the Reading manager during a six-month spell that ended in December 2009 when the player was making his name in the club's academy. Rodgers sent McCarthy on loan to Yeovil but knew he would return to stake a claim for a place in the first team. His opportunity came earlier this season when he was chosen ahead of Adam Federici by Brian McDermott for the visit of Tottenham. Reading lost 3-1 but McCarthy became the team's No1 until a shoulder injury picked up in early November checked his momentum. This was his first appearance since then, having undergone an operation, and it ended with the former England Under-21 international having made 10 saves. "It was nice to come back with a bang," he said. "This was the first injury that's kept me out for more than a couple of weeks so it's disappointing being in the treatment room. But I'm now where I want to be." It appeared McCarthy's standout save was the one from Luis Suárez's point-blank shot late on that he clutched to his chest. Yet the player chose his diving parry of Steven Gerrard's long-range drive that arrived moments earlier. "It came from in front of Sean Morrison so I saw it late," he said. "Overall, this is the best performance I've had." McCarthy, who is 6ft 4ins tall and "modelled my game on Petr Cech", was the only Reading player to emerge from the game with credit. His outfield colleagues displayed the tentativeness of a side sat at the foot of the Premier League. The hosts, who are 10 points from safetywith five matches to play, were overwhelmed by a Liverpool team whose attacking trio of Phillippe Coutinho, Daniel Sturridge and Suárez moved with breathtaking fluidity and pace. In total, Liverpool had 23 shots on goal compared with Reading's five. There was frustration, then, for the visitors on a day when the 96 Liverpool supporters who died at the Hillsborough disaster, the 24th anniversary of which is on Monday, had been remembered before the kick-off with a minute's silence. For Rodgers, however, positives could be taken from a result that leaves his side in seventh place five points behind Everton in sixth. "Everyone can see we've improved," he said. "We've got top players and once we bring in more quality we'll move up to to the next level." Man of the match Alex McCarthy (Reading)

Rafael Benítez said he had no problems with the squabble that erupted between David Luiz and Frank Lampard as the teams departed at half-time, pointing to the tête-a-tête as recognition of a need to improve. Chelsea eventually forced their way into the Europa League semi-finals 5-4 on aggregate despite a sloppy 3-2 defeat by Rubin Kazan. David Luiz and Lampard became embroiled in an argument in the middle of the pitch as they retreated towards the changing rooms; the finger-jabbing continuing until they approached the tunnel, where Petr Cech and Yossi Benayoun shepherded them away from each other. The disagreement came in the stadium where Blackburn Rovers' David Batty and Graeme Le Saux famously fought one another in 1995. On this occasion, the frustration appeared to be born of a chance conceded to Gokdeniz Karadeniz just before the whistle, which Cech had pushed to safety, with Lampard initially unhappy at the ease with which the Russian club had created the opportunity. The visitors were hardly defensively sound over the remainder of the tie, with Rubin scoring three – albeit one a soft penalty after Aleksandr Ryazantsev's dive – and clipping a post, though Benítez put the vulnerability down to playing in an arena with 65,000 empty seats. "It's always good to have players arguing about things that happen on the pitch so you can correct these things at half-time," he said. "We were talking about that, adjusting positions, so it's fine. Not a problem." The Spaniard singled out the little-used Paulo Ferreira and Nathan Ake for praise, despite both enduring awkward evenings. "You have to put all this into context," he said. "We came here to play on a synthetic pitch which, although it's the same for both sides, is not ideal; [Ryan] Bertrand couldn't come so we had to play Paulo, who'd not played for a while, at left-back; and we have another game on Sunday, another big semi-final [in the FA Cup], so to score twice and go through makes us really pleased. Yes, we're disappointed we didn't defend well in the second half, but still we go through. "The timing of the goals made it harder. Our first made a big difference in the tie and made us confident: not over-confident, but when they scored we had to start again. The same with our second goal: the game felt finished but it wasn't. We had to work hard again. We had to deal much better with the crosses, something we couldn't do, but credit to all our players. Despite the circumstances, we're in another semi-final." That will be the 18th of the Roman Abramovich era and maintains Chelsea's pursuit of a trophy despite a trying and draining campaign. Lampard said: "People try and talk this competition down but we have been very professional and the closer you get to the final, the more special it gets. We have to get home and concentrate on the FA Cup now. We have a lot of games coming up but have big squad so today is a confidence booster. We're into a semi-final, now we want to get into a final." Benítez added: "In terms of this season, it's another semi-final. We've played a final [in the Fifa Club World Cup], another semi-final [in the Capital One Cup], and we're in two more semi-finals. I know we are disappointed with some of the defending in the second half here, but this game has to be put into proper context. It was a different kind of environment, but I think we did well."

A 88th-minute penalty from Kane Hemmings earned Dundee a hard-fought draw with Motherwell in the Scottish Premiership at Dens Park. Mark McGhee’s Motherwell led the contest for over an hour and were on course to move within a point of Dundee with first-half goals from Chris Cadden, thanks to Marvin Johnson’s assist, and Stephen Pearson superb solo effort. With Paul McGowan’s goal for Dundee after six minutes sandwiched inbetween. Pearson’s goal especially stood out, with the former Derby midfielder collecting the ball and bursting through the home defence before firing past Scott Bain in the Dundee goal for his seventh goal of the season. But Paul Hartley’s Dundee dug in for their point and Hemmings dashed Motherwell’s hopes when he struck with an 88th-minute spot-kick after Cadden had fouled Kevin Holt inside the box. With the point, Hartley’s team climbed above Inverness into sixth position in the Premiership table. The games between Inverness and Hearts and Partick versus Dundee United were postponed due to adverse weather conditions. A second-half header from Carlton Morris gave Hamilton a 1-0 win over relegation rivals Kilmarnock at Rugby Park and applied more pressure on the Kilmarnock manager, Gary Locke. Morris connected with an Ali Crawford corner to secure the three points for Hamilton, their second win in 17 games took them four points ahead of Kilmarnock. The home side had few real chances although Kris Boyd did hit the crossbar with a free-kick after 65 minutes. Gary Locke’s side, who were jeered off the pitch by their home fans at the final whistle, remain in the relegation play-off position, 11 points clear of basement team Dundee United. Locke’s job is already in jeopardy after being well beaten by United last Saturday. In the Championship, the on-loan midfielder Billy King scored a late winning goal on his debut as leaders Rangers snatched a dramatic 1-0 win against Falkirk at Ibrox. The last meeting between the two teams was an entertaining encounter at the Falkirk Stadium, with Peter Houston’s Falkirk side coming out winners with a 2-1 win. But goal opportunities were at a premium in this game due to the blustery conditions. The 21-year-old Hearts winger King made a surprise six-month loan switch to Ibrox this week and celebrated the move when he met a James Tavernier cross with a stoppage-time diving header to earn his new side three points. Rangers had appeared to be heading towards their first game without scoring under Mark Warburton but King’s winner moves them eight points clear of their nearest rivals Hibernian, who were in League Cup semi-final action. It was a blow for Houston’s disciplined Falkirk team, whose title hopes appear to be over having now fallen 10 points behind Rangers.

Luis Suárez has confirmed he wants to leave Liverpool in the latest interview to express his disillusionment with life in England. The Liverpool striker has given three interviews in the past two days to encourage interest from Real Madrid, the first to reveal he would find it hard to say no to the Spanish club, the second suggesting now is the time for a "change of environment" and the third finally confirming his intention to leave Anfield. Liverpool have responded to Suárez's latest announcement, though they have been unable to rein in the 26-year-old while on international duty in his native Uruguay. A club spokesperson said: "Luis Suárez is not for sale. Neither Luis or his representatives have communicated these feelings directly to Liverpool football club. The club remains supportive of Luis and expect him to honour his contract. We will not be making any further comment at this stage." Suárez has repeatedly insisted his reason for wanting to leave Liverpool is not financial or the lure of Champions League football, but his treatment by the press in England. Ahead of Uruguay's friendly against France in Montevideo on 4 June, Suárez told a press conference: "It is a difficult moment for me. My coach and my colleagues know that they [the media] didn't treat me well. Because of the paparazzi I could not go in my garden, I could not go to the supermarket. My reason for leaving is not the money. It's my family and image. I don't feel comfortable here any more." Suárez was a target for photographers after he sunk his teeth into the Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic in April, an act that resulted in a 10-match ban from the Football Association and, he has now confirmed, prompted him to reconsider his future in English football. "The straw that broke the camel's back was my mistake," he said of his second suspension for biting an opponent. The first came at Ajax in November 2010. The Liverpool striker insists he has not agreed a deal with Real, and his agent, Pere Guardiola, contradicted his client's utterances on Thursday by claiming Suárez remains happy at Anfield. Liverpool have feared the striker would push for a move despite the club's firm support over the Patrice Evra racism controversy and the Ivanovic issue. Those two incidents alone have landed Suárez with suspensions totalling 18 games but the Uruguayan claims it is the press who have sullied his image. He said: "It's a good moment for a change of environment because of all I've been through in England, where I haven't been judged as a player but based on other things. I had a hard time, very hard, in the things that have been said are lies. One has limits and the family also suffers. They treated me bad and it would be understandable if one day I go to my club [and the media are waiting for him] but I cannot walk my baby – the paparazzi are always there. "My family, my image – that's what matters to me most. The coach and some colleagues know that I suffered, I was treated badly and I did not feel comfortable and they know perfectly. "It's nothing against Liverpool, on the contrary, I feel very comfortable at the club, but I have a daughter and I do not want [her] to hear bad things about her father. In England they talk about many things and in some ways I feel uncomfortable. I do not know when I'm going and I do not know if I'm staying. If I stay it is because it is a great club but also in turn I know that it is difficult because of the harassment I get from the press." In his latest interview, however, Suárez confirms a decision to leave has been made.

Roy Hodgson has insisted he is "not a person stuck with a system" as he was forced to defend himself from criticism ahead of Sunday's friendly against Brazil and the specific allegation that his preference for a 4-4-2 formation is outdated. England's 1-1 draw with the Republic of Ireland led to Gary Lineker complaining the team had taken a "step back to the dark ages" by reverting to the formation that most of the leading national teams have abandoned. Lineker also predicted England would suffer badly in the Maracanã unless Hodgson changed his "predictable and dated" system for a match the Brazilians are using to prepare for the Confederations Cup. "Well, that's a pity," Hodgson said. "I thought we played well [against Ireland]. What is the dark ages? We were playing two front players and asking at least one of those front players, when we lose the ball, to make certain he drops down and helps out in midfield. Just as Borussia Dortmund did in the [Champions League]final. Just like we've done in the past." Hodgson said he was "not prepared to discuss what systems are modern and what systems aren't" but made it clear he felt the criticism was unjustified. "I'm never surprised by what things are said and done, to be perfectly honest. I can tell you only what I think. I thought a lot of the things we did were good. "With [Daniel] Sturridge and [Wayne] Rooney, the way we went out was the right way. If neither of those two are available, we might have to do something different. I'm not a person stuck with a system, I'm stuck with principles and I am stuck in my belief that it's football players who win matches and you need to get your best players on the field in positions that suit them. "I would be more than surprised if any of the players should be criticised for lack of effort, desire and intention. They should be criticised only for not taking chances." The England manager is acutely aware, however, that his injury-depleted side face a formidable assignment against Brazil, in direct contrast to an Ireland side featuring only two players from clubs that finished in the top half of the Premier League. "The games we're preparing for are a few months ahead whereas they [Brazil] are preparing for games a couple of weeks ahead. "There's a major difference there. And let's be fair, four or five, maybe even six, players who I'd give serious consideration to playing aren't with us. So it will be a great opportunity for some of the other ones." Sturridge's ankle injury, with Andy Carroll having already withdrawn, Danny Welbeck a major doubt and Jermain Defoe short of full fitness, means Hodgson may have to contemplate a more central role for Theo Walcott. His decision largely depends on Defoe's fitness after the Tottenham striker played almost an hour as a substitute for Sturridge against Ireland. "We've been a bit unlucky with front players, that's for sure," Hodgson said. "We were quite pleased with the way he [Sturridge] and Rooney were combining in that short spell and I thought it was going to be an interesting 90 minutes to see how this young man developed. "Jermain is not firing on all cylinders. He came to us not having played the last few games for Tottenham and he is feeling his achilles. He did a good job for us but we did miss Sturridge just as we missed Welbeck. "But we'll have to get on with it and make ourselves as competitive against Brazil as the Irish were against us. "Every time you play a game with England, even if you are playing without any of your first-choice players, you're still expected to get a result, even if it will be hard to get. We know it will be tough. It was tough for the Irish but they worked hard and got it."

The former Chelsea striker Adrian Mutu has told Romanian television that he wants to adopt the baby saved from a sewage pipe in China. The newborn boy, weighing just 5lbs, was found wedged in the pipe beneath a shared bathroom in a residential building in Jinhua, in China's eastern province of Zhejiang. His story quickly spread worldwide, with footage of his rescue showing medics at Pujiang People's hospital helping to dismantle the 10cm diameter pipe piece by piece with pliers and saws. State media said the baby had a low heart rate when he was admitted and had suffered cuts and bruising, but was now in stable condition. The mother of Baby 59 – known only by the number of his hospital incubator – has since come forward, saying she kept her pregnancy secret after the father refused to stand by her and she could not afford an abortion. However, Mutu, who signed for Chelsea for £15.8m in 2003, but was released the following year after failing a drugs test, told Romanian channel ProTV: "I intend to adopt this baby." The AC Ajaccio striker, a father of three, said he had discussed the plan with his wife Consuelo, and they would go ahead, if a legal agreement could be reached. Romania is not currently on the list of 17 countries whose citizens can adopt from China. Mutu said: "I couldn't figure out how to carry on living, how to eat my breakfast when I saw this story on TV. He's a special child. When I saw the baby I said 'I must adopt him, he has been sent to me by God.' "Just look at this poor little fellow. He made such a strong impression on me. I told my wife we have to help him, we have to do everything we can. "I never thought I would adopt a baby, I had no plan concerning that, but I just know: I have to help this one."

And that’s that! Klopp isn’t smiling now, as Liverpool now have another game to fit into an already crowded calendar. Woeful finishing by Benteke and Teixeira in the second half cost them, though in truth West Ham deserved at least a draw, and indeed could easily have snatched it towards the end. There’s also that penalty shout for handball off Caulker to consider. Bilic very much the happier of the two managers, as the teams go back to the Boleyn Ground for the replay. Liverpool’s kids have done a bit better against West Ham than their first-teamers, you’ll note. 90 min +1: West Ham hit the post! Cresswell makes ground down the left, and loops to the far post. Antonio rises, and crashes a header across Mignolet and off the inside of the left-hand post! But it wouldn’t have counted anyway, as Antonio had hands on the back of Lovren, while Cresswell’s cross might have curled out of play and back in. 90 min: Farcical scenes as Enrique’s weak free kick fails to beat the first man and West Ham flood upfield on the break. That move peters out easily enough. On the touchline, Klopp and Bilic share a joke. There will be three added minutes. 89 min: Smith nicks the ball off Obiang down the Liverpool left, and is bundled over by the same player. A free kick. Before that can be taken, Enrique comes on for Teixeira. In fact, Enrique’s first involvement will be to take the free kick. 88 min: And the replay’s nearly avoided, though not in the way Klopp would like. O’Brien makes good down the right, and finds Antonio in the box, 12 yards out, level with the right-hand post. Antonio shifts his feet and gets a shot away, but Caulker has closed him down well. The ball balloons out for a corner, which comes to nothing. 86 min: Reid bowls Teixeira to the ground, 35 yards from goal on the right. Free kick. The ball’s sent towards Stewart on the left-hand corner of the box. The young man flashes a harmless shot deep into the Kop. And then Klopp swaps Brannagan for Sinclair. He really doesn’t want a replay, I’ll be bound. 85 min: A clever Payet pass down the right releases O’Brien into space. He should advance on the Liverpool area, but attempts one from Gerrard Country. Nope! It finds the top-right corner of the stand behind the goal. 84 min: Antonio flings a long throw into the Liverpool box from the right. Bedlam, bedlam, bedlam. Mignolet flaps. Caulker fails to clear. Valencia goes down, but that’s never a penalty, no contact. He smiles as he gets up while Allen clears. 82 min: Valencia loses possession as he dribbles down the left. Teixeira breaks upfield with West Ham light at the back. He’s got Benteke on his left, Ojo in space down the right. He plays a nothing pass straight ahead of him, allowing Randolph to mop up quietly. A suggestion Teixeira was taken out by Song as he played the ball forward - Klopp is enjoying some hot chat with the fourth official - but in truth there looked little wrong with the challenge. 80 min: A couple of minutes’ worth of sterile Liverpool possession, and Klopp’s patience snaps. He swaps Ibe for Ojo, who scored a fine goal in the third-round replay win over Exeter City. 77 min: Liverpool are dominating the game, but it all goes wrong whenever they get near to West Ham’s box. Allen busies himself down the left. He lays off to Benteke, who has Smith bombing into space on the overlap. His pass down the flank is way too heavy, and batters the hoardings running along the front of the Kop. 75 min: Ibe slides a lovely pass down the inside-right channel to release Benteke into the area. Benteke looks for the bottom left. Randolph parries. Allen tries to latch onto the rebound but the ball breaks to Benteke. The striker should slide the ball left to Teixeira, totally free, but lumps a weak shot straight at Randolph. Another huge chance spurned. Will Liverpool regret these big misses? 74 min: Clyne romps into acres down the right. He crosses. Allen attempts a bicycle kick, and swishes fresh air. But no matter, because the ball ends up at the feet of Teixeira, ten yards out and level with the left-hand post. He must score, but batters his shot straight at Randolph, who nevertheless should win praise for his parry. That’s a huge chance passed up. 72 min: Ibe tries to bomb down the middle but runs straight into Song. O’Brien plays a simple pass out of play on the right. Caulker slices a basic hoof upfield into the main stand. It’s gone scrappy again. 70 min: Moses is replaced by Antonio. West Ham have used all of their subs. Liverpool are yet to make a change. 68 min: Stewart turns on the jets to burst down the left, and is upended by Song. A free kick and a chance for Liverpool to pack the West Ham area. Teixeira pitching-wedges it into the mixer. West Ham half clear. Stewart pearls it goalwards from outside the box. It’s going wide left, but falls to the feet of Benteke, who is onside, on the edge of the six-yard box. His attempt to control is a shank off towards the right wing. This £32.5m price-tag is weighing heavy. 66 min: Teixeira slips a lovely diagonal pass wide right to Clyne, who hits a first-time low cross towards Benteke in the centre. But before the big striker can sidefoot home from close range, Reid slides in to hook clear brilliantly. Liverpool recycle the ball, allowing Smith to dispatch it into Row Z of the Kop. 64 min: The resulting corner’s hit deep and high, and Lovren’s got no chance of keeping his header down, or getting it on target. 63 min: Smith busies himself down the left, chasing after a Benteke pass, and cuts back for Teixeira, who from the left of the D sends a rising scorcher towards the top left. Randolph gets his hands warm, tipping the smart shot round the post well. 61 min: Payet gives the ball away to Allen, to the right of the Liverpool box. Allen slips the ball inside to Benteke, who should be shooting from ten yards, but BREAKING NEWS he’s totally bereft of confidence and lays it back to Allen, who can only win a corner from his tight angle. The set piece is wasted. 60 min: Clyne drifts in from the right, and slides a pass across the face of the West Ham box. It’s perfectly weighted for Allen to stride onto, with the Hammers defence all over the place. But Allen leans back and welts a dismal effort high into the Kop. That was a magnificent opportunity to make Randolph do some serious work. 59 min: There were 24 goals in Liverpool’s last six matches. That one-in-four average looks in severe danger right now. 57 min: A free kick for Liverpool now, out on the left. Brannagan curls one into the box for Caulker, but Reid gets in first to ensure the ball’s guided away from the danger zone, and Randolph eventually snaffles. 55 min: From the free kick out towards the left, Payet sends the ball looping towards the top right from 35 yards. It doesn’t Konchesky its way into the net. Mignolet claims. 54 min: Moses goes on a determined skitter down the middle of the park. He one-twos with Jelavic, and prepares to break into a little space down the inside left. Lovren, knowing full well there’s plenty of cover, he’s not the last man, and he’s not risking a red card, takes Moses out with an almighty clatter. He’s booked, and can have no complaints whatsoever. 52 min: They’ve shown that West Ham penalty shout again. Caulker touches the ball twice. It’s hardly Thierry Henry basketball cheek - it was all very quick, and in a tight space - but it was a penalty kick nevertheless. Liverpool got away with that. 50 min: Clyne, gliding in from the right, unleashes a rising rasper which only just flies wide of the top-left corner. A fine attempt. 49 min: Stewart goes clattering into Jelavic down the West Ham left. Free kick, and yet another chance for Payet to deliver something special. Which he does, and there’s an almighty scramble in the six-yard box. A proper old-school scramble, a dust cloud with feet and fists sticking out of it. Jelavic flicks on, Caulker chests down and hacks. Suggestion of a handball, and you’ve certainly seen them given. Goodness knows how Liverpool keep it out, but that’s exactly what they achieve. Hearts in mouths around Anfield for a second there. West Ham might have a legitimate complaint about that non-penalty. 48 min: And so, having said that, the next couple of minutes are beyond scrappy. 46 min: Lovren heads up the left wing from deep. Allen heads on to ... himself, then slides a first-time ball down the channel in the hope of releasing Benteke. Nearly. Then Moses makes good down the West Ham right, whipping a cross to the near post where there’s nobody other than Mignolet. A bright start to the second half, by a couple of teams who clearly fancy their chances after an open first 45. West Ham get the ball rolling for the second half. No changes. “Watching Allen challenge the West Ham goalie while Benteke looks on sums up my growing love for one player over the other,” comments Ian Copestake, who may or may not be speaking for many. Half-time omen: The last season West Ham did the league double over Liverpool was 1963-64. This happened at the end of it ... And that’s that for the opening 45. A lively and interesting first half, with the scoreline about right, Brannagan and Obiang both going close with magnificent long-range efforts. It’s nicely poised for the second half. No flipping! 45 min +1: From the free kick, the ball finds the feet of Obiang, 25 yards from goal in a central position. Obiang threads a brilliant shot through a thicket and towards the bottom left. Deliberate excellence. Mignolet is beaten all ends up, but the ball whistles an inch or two wide left of the post. So close to the opening goal! 45 min: Smith, on the edge of his own area, plays a fairly obvious cushioned back pass to Mignolet, who gathers. That should be an indirect free kick. What were the pair thinking? But it’s not. West Ham are rightfully furious. Then Smith’s in the thick of it again, taking down O’Brien on the right, a cynical charge. He should go in the book but doesn’t. Then again, see Reid a few minutes earlier on Teixeira, so fair’s fair. 44 min: Allen, a bit too bright in the tackle, concedes one down the right now in a duel with Obiang. West Ham load the box. Payet hits it deep, allowing Clyne to eyebrow it away from danger. 43 min: Brannagan slams a witless one into the wall. He picks up the rebound and hoicks it into the mixer. West Ham clear. Liverpool send it back in. Allen, a goal machine these days, goes up for a high one with Randolph. He clatters into the keeper, and that’s a free kick. Pressure off. 42 min: Teixeira cuts across the front of the West Ham box from the left. He’s hauled down, unceremoniously so, by the collar, by Reid. A free kick in a very dangerous position. Brannagan, who has been Liverpool’s most potent attacking force so far, fancies this. 39 min: O’Brien purchases a pretty cheap free kick off a clumsy Stewart as the pair battle down the West Ham right. Another chance for the visitors to load the box. Payet curls a dangerous one to the near post, where Smith clears. Liverpool try to break quickly down the left, only to give the ball away. West Ham attempt to launch a counter to the counter, and that fizzles out quickly enough as well. It’s a fast and engaging game, but a little short on quality. To be expected, I guess, with both teams having made so many changes, and West Ham forced into another couple thanks to injury. 37 min: Kouyate appears to have taken a knock. He disappears off down the tunnel as former Evertonian Jelavic comes on to replace him. A couple of blows for West Ham in quick succession there, as they’re forced to burn two substitutions before the first half is out. 35 min: Nope. O’Brien comes on in his stead. Meanwhile Brannagan, from Steven Gerrard Country, unleashes a rising rasper towards the top right. It’s a stunning effort, and met by a stunning save from Randolph, who was unsighted for a second there. Wonderful football all round. The corner comes to nothing. 34 min: Tomkins has gone off down the tunnel to receive treatment, a stitch or two perhaps. Will he come back? 33 min: Liverpool are beginning to re-emerge as an attacking force. Teixeira and Ibe take turns to dribble around down the left, but neither can work the space for a shot. The ball’s fed to Benteke on the edge of the area, and he’s got Clyne in acres to the right, but he’s incredibly ponderous and the move breaks down. 32 min: Tomkins looks a bit groggy at the moment. West Ham are hoping he’ll be able to continue, but he’s off the pitch right now as the game restarts, and frowning quite a lot. 31 min: Allen and Tomkins go up for a high ball in the midfield. A complete accident, both players with their eyes shut, but Tomkins plants his nut on the back of Allen’s head. Allen walks away rubbing his noggin. Poor Tomkins has taken that full in the face, though, and is down in some pain. The physio’s on, and he’s mopping up a fair bit of blood. 29 min: Allen slides a pass down the inside-right channel to find Benteke in the West Ham box. Reid nips across to belt the ball out for a corner. Allen drops the set piece on the penalty spot. Caulker, who has caused more than his fair share of bedlam in attack for Liverpool since his arrival, tries to volley home. He succeeds only in clattering Kouyate. Free kick. 26 min: Payet swings a ball into the Liverpool box from the left. It’s deep, and dropping towards Kouyate to the right of goal, 12 yards out. Kouyate heads back into the centre, the ball hitting Smith’s arm. But Smith had his back to goal, and was mid jump; it didn’t appear to be a deliberate motion. In fairness to West Ham, Kouyate’s appeal is only half-arsed. 25 min: Stewart and Teixeira combine down the middle of the park, the latter shuttling the ball forward for Benteke, who romps after it through a big hole in the West Ham defence. But Randolph is out quickly to claim on the edge of his area. Fine anticipation from the keeper there. 23 min: A free kick for Liverpool, out deep on the left. Brannagan curls deep for Benteke, who hangs out a leg and misses the dipping ball from six yards. Randolph gathers. That’s a fine chance spurned. 22 min: From the corner, Brannagan swings long. Benteke glances a header towards the bottom right. Cresswell, on the line, boots clear. That was probably going wide anyway. 21 min: Ibe injects a little pace into Liverpool’s game, bursting through a challenge in the centre circle and driving forward with great intent. He exchanges passes with Teixeira on the left-hand corner of the area and makes his way into the box. His low cross is hacked behind by Tomkins. 19 min: A bit of space for Teixeira out on the left. He’s only got Benteke to aim for in the box, and the big striker’s movement isn’t up to much. Teixeira fires a ball in his general direction, but his cross is easily blocked. 18 min: Liverpool are having serious trouble holding onto the ball. Possession a pipe dream right now. West Ham are looking very comfortable at the moment, having worked their way into their groove. 16 min: Cresswell, out wide on the left, loops a cross towards Valencia on the penalty spot. Lovren looks to head clear, but gets under it and misses it altogether, losing the flight totally. Valencia, surprised that the ball’s got to him, sends an absurd diving header straight out to the left wing again, when it was surely easier to score. What a chance! 15 min: Allen and Benteke confuse each other in the midfield. Space for Moses down the right. His low ball into the Liverpool area is trapped by Valencia on the penalty spot, though the striker’s back is to goal. He tries to spin and get a shot away; he just about manages a half turn and sends the ball dribbling towards Mignolet, who gathers. Lovren did well to stay tight there. 12 min: After their brisk start, Liverpool aren’t seeing much of the ball now. West Ham are beginning to impose themselves, winning the majority of 50-50 challenges in the middle. Anfield getting a bit tense as a result, the constant noise from the away corner apart. 10 min: Stewart upends Obiang out on the right. A free kick, and a chance for West Ham to load the box. Everyone’s to the left of the D. Payet, from 35 yards, tries to send a McAllister-versus-Everton-style surprise effort into the right-hand side of the net, unguarded by Mignolet as it is. But it’s just wide right of goal, and the keeper was over to cover anyway. Clever effort by a quick thinker, though. 9 min: Valencia and Moses exchange sweetly down the middle, and nearly set Obiang free in the box. Caulker is on hand to hook clear, just as it looked like the West Ham midfielder would find room for a shot. 7 min: Moses nearly skips his way past Smith down the right, but has to make do with a corner. The ever-excellent Payet takes. It’s flicked clear by Allen at the near post. Suddenly, on the break, Teixeira is putting serious pressure on Ogbonna, the only Hammer tracking back. Ogbonna keeps up the pace and sees off the danger. West Ham hoick upfield. Liverpool come again, Ibe cutting in from the left and setting up Brannagan, who converts for some rugby-union points. A wild effort. 5 min: Liverpool are seeing most of the ball early doors. They’re snapping into tackles. Stewart robs Song to set up an attack. Benteke’s loose control ensures the move breaks down. Brannagan tries to keep the momentum up, but he slides in unfairly on Song this time, and the pressure’s relieved. 3 min: Smith rolls a ball down the left to win a corner off Tomkins. From the set piece, Smith swings a cross in from the left. West Ham half clear. Then Brannagan has a go from the same flank. His vicious dipping cross nearly finds Benteke at the far post, but Reid gets his head on the ball first to guide the ball back to Randolph. Cool, collected defending. 2 min: Cresswell makes a couple of runs down the left. He presses Liverpool back towards their own box, but he eventually lets the ball run out for a throw. The home side clear. A fast-paced end-to-end start to this match. Liverpool get the ball rolling. They’ll be defending the Kop end in the first half, attacking it in the second, which is just how they like it. Teixeira bursts down the right but is chased off the ball early enough. Then a bit of space for Allen down the same wing, but his cross into the Hammers box in the direction of Benteke is way too strong. A brisk start, with plenty of bedlam the soundtrack. The teams are out! Liverpool are in their traditional red clobber, while West Ham must ditch their famous claret-and-blue combo for the sake of clarity. They’re in third-choice dark blue. A cracking atmosphere at Anfield, a rousing singalong to Gerry and the Pacemakers with the away fans blowing plenty of Bubbles in return. Slaven Bilic speaks! “We deserved to win both of our league games, but the matches were very difficult and we had to be at our best. Based on that we are confident and optimistic, but we also know that only one team can be a favourite at Anfield, and that is Liverpool. Adrian’s wife is giving birth in Spain, but Randolph would have been in goal for the cup anyway. Mark Noble has flu. We had bad injuries in November and December, which obviously we did not want, but the good thing about that is we played more players, and now we have 15 or 16 regulars.” Jurgen Klopp speaks! “The selection is risky, yes, but we are without an alternative as we have played the highest number of games in the last few weeks, nine in 20-odd days. And the last one was very intense! We cannot ignore this. But we cannot ignore the quality of our opponents too. We are for sure not the favourites because West Ham are in a really good moment, but we will try to challenge. If you think I am being disrespectful against the FA Cup I cannot change that, but we are full of respect for the FA Cup and have a responsibility to our fans too. At the end there are some people who will say well done [puts thumbs up and wears cheesy grin, Paul McCartney style] and some will criticise it. But we have a few good players and some young talent. I like this!” Liverpool are much changed, as expected, for their ninth game in January. Simon Mignolet is the only player who started the League Cup semi-final second-leg against Stoke City to retain his place. It’s arguably a stronger side than some expected: Nathaniel Clyne and Dejan Lovren return, Steven Caulker finally gets a go as a defender, Joe Allen captains the side, and first-team regulars Jordon Ibe and Christian Benteke will be on the attack. But the bench is packed with kids. And Jose Enrique. West Ham ring the changes too, for their sixth game of the month. They make five to the side that started the 2-2 draw with Manchester City last Saturday. Adrian, Carl Jenkinson, Mark Noble, James Collins and Michail Antonio make way for Darren Randolph, James Tomkins, Angelo Ogbonna, Pedro Obiang and former Liverpool winger Victor Moses. Liverpool: Mignolet, Clyne, Lovren, Caulker, Smith, Allen, Brannagan, Stewart, Ibe, Teixeira, Benteke. Subs: Ward, Enrique, Ilori, Chrivella, Ojo, Sinclair, Randall. West Ham United: Randolph, Tomkins, Reid, Ogbonna, Cresswell, Obiang, Song, Kouyate, Moses, Payet, Valencia. Subs: Howes, O’Brien, Collins, Oxford, Cullen, Antonio, Jelavic. Referee: Martin Atkinson (West Yorkshire). Liverpool have won their six previous FA Cup ties with West Ham United, most recently the Gerrard Final of 2006. Sounds promising for the seven-time cup winners. But that’s where their good news ends. Until this season, West Ham hadn’t won at Anfield since 1963. That was quite the barren spell, but Slaven Bilic’s side slaked their thirst in stunning fashion back in August, thrashing a side then managed by Brendan Rodgers 3-0. That set up the possibility of West Ham’s first league double over Liverpool in 52 years, something secured earlier this month when the Hammers easily dispatched a team now led by Jurgen Klopp 2-0 at Upton Park. So they’ve won three of their last four matches against Liverpool. The aggregate score’s 8-3. Head-to-heads aside, West Ham also look in better general nick. They’ve won four of their last six games, and were sparkling in attack when drawing with Manchester City last weekend. Liverpool by contrast are spluttering a little bit: just two wins in their last six, and one of those was against Exeter City while the other was that wild 5-4 win at Norwich, an erratic performance which raised more questions than it answered. Yet the mood music around Liverpool remains positive. Not least because they’ve just made it to next month’s League Cup final, their first showpiece occasion for four years. They’ll be hoping to ride the buzz of Tuesday night’s penalty shoot-out win over Stoke City, and pay West Ham back for that league double. The high-pressing Hammers, by contrast, will be confident of continuing their excellent form against defensively shaky opponents, as they go in search of their fourth FA Cup. It’s beautifully balanced. It promises to be a cracker. It’s on! Kick off: 5.30pm GMT.

The Wigan Athletic chairman, Dave Whelan, has said he expects Roberto Martínez to decide whether he is staying with the relegated FA Cup winners on Thursday. Martínez and Whelan met on Wednesday to discuss the club's plans following relegation from the Premier League, and the manager's uncertain future. The 39-year-old has been heavily linked with the manager's position at Everton following David Moyes's departure for Manchester United, while Stoke City and Málaga have also been mentioned as potential destinations as they prepare for life after Tony Pulis and Manuel Pellegrini respectively. Everton and Stoke say they have not yet made any approaches in their search for a new manager. Whelan, however, claims his manager has several options, including whether to attempt to guide Wigan back to the top flight next season. "Roberto wants 24 hours to think about what is going on," the Wigan chairman said. "Tomorrow is D-day." Martínez is under contract at the DW Stadium until 2014 and Whelan believes his manager's decision also rests on whether he wishes to continue with the club following relegation. He added: "I had a meeting with Roberto at noon today. It was a very constructive meeting where we discussed all kinds of things – winning the Cup, our relegation, our prospects for next season. "Roberto wants to speak to his wife, think about it, which I fully understand. We are going to meet tomorrow and Roberto is going to make his mind up whether he wants to continue his contract with Wigan or whether he wants to take up a new position elsewhere. There is a massive amount of loyalty between Roberto and myself. If he wants to stay, that is fantastic and I will be over the moon. But if he decides he wants to move on I will fully respect that and I will give him every bit of support I can." Everton are taking their time over a replacement for Moyes, and have denied reports in Portugal that Porto's coach, Vitor Pereira, has agreed a two-year deal at Goodison Park. Stoke have only just commenced their search having parted company with Pulis on Tuesday. Pulis issued a statement through the League Managers Association that lists the achievements from his "wonderful adventure" with Stoke but confirmed his disappointment at leaving after seven years. It read: "Peter [Coates, the owner], his family and I have enjoyed every inch of the journey; he has been truly a fantastic man to work with. Although I am disappointed, I do understand what he means when he says the board feels a need to take the club in a different direction. In leaving I am very proud of what we have all achieved."

This tie appeared ripe for an upset from the outset, considering only one team in England have scored more league goals than Peterborough this season and West Brom have struggled to manage a shot on target of late. The reintroduction of Saido Berahino, hitting a brace in his first start since October, had Albion in front twice but they were pegged back on both occasions and now face a trip to London Road to decide who advances to the fifth round. Peterborough looked somewhat overawed in a first half addled with the most basic of errors but by the end were good value for their inclusion in this draw. Graham Westley’s young team could easily have been three goals down before Shaquile Coulthirst, scoring his first goal for the League One club since joining from Tottenham last week, made it 1-1 when capitalising on a communication mix up between Boaz Myhill and Sébastien Pocognoli. Berahino, who is expected to stay at West Brom until the summer despite interest from Tottenham and Newcastle, put Albion back in front within five minutes thanks to a tidy right-footed finish into the far corner after Craig Dawson played him in, but the substitute Jon Taylor restored parity less than two minutes after in a wonderful finish to a match that had plodded along for 75 minutes. “The most pleasing thing for me is a lot of young players have grown up and gained self-belief this afternoon,” Westley said. “We acquitted ourselves well, we found our way into the game after a nervy start and we showed a lot of character and a lot of determination to find our way back in.” The result deepens Tony Pulis’s headache. For a team that puts so much emphasis on defensive resilience, their marking was uncharacteristically loose for both goals. Swansea City and Newcastle United are faced in the next week and a failure to win either of those could leave them in a relegation fight before renewing acquaintances with Peterborough. “It’s disappointing but that’s cup football,” the West Brom manager said. “We started really well in the first 20 to 25 minutes and the game should have been put to bed. One mistake put them back in it – Boaz and Poco have left it for one another and their lad has stepped in. I don’t want to discredit Peterborough, they were brilliant, but I didn’t see them creating many chances before that.” Having failed to register a single attempt on target against Aston Villa last weekend, Berahino converted with Albion’s first attempt. Peterborough, though, were the architects of their own downfall after overplaying in midfield, allowing Rickie Lambert to pick up the loose ball and stride forward. He fed Berahino who steadied before curling into the bottom right corner from about 20 yards. “He’s not fit and his sharpness is nowhere as good as last year,” Pulis said of the 22-year-old. “But one thing you can’t take away from the kid is when he gets in front of goal he is calm and has that wonderful ability to finish.” The best Peterborough could fashion before half-time was a Coulthirst shot that drifted narrowly wide, and they were lucky a smorgasbord of sloppy defensive play did not leave the tie out of reach by the interval. Half an hour in a dodgy backpass from Michael Smith to Ben Alnwick almost saw Lambert benefit only for the goalkeeper to recover from his initial botched clearance. Soon after James McClean stole the ball from a dawdling Ricardo Santos but shot right at Alnwick, while the Republic of Ireland winger also struck wide from a promising position after a neat give-and-go with Lambert. Lambert went close again two minutes after the break when picked out by Stéphane Sessègnon on the right after Berahino had stolen possession from Chris Forrester deep in the visitors’ half. Gradually, however, the Posh gained a foothold. Smith spurned a good chance 20 minutes from the end, shooting straight at Myhill after being played in by Coulthirst. The recent signing, though, levelled with a tasty volley after Michael Bostwick’s long diagonal pass. Myhill, back in the team for the first time since Ben Foster’s return from injury, was caught in two minds over whether to come out to punch and Pocognoli allowed the striker in front of him to finish brilliantly at the near post with the goalkeeper backtracking. Berahino went one step further to rehabilitating his fragile relationship with the club by putting Pulis’s side in front again but Taylor, who had slipped to allow Berahino an extra yard of space, enjoyed the last word when making the most of some ropey defending after Santos’ diagonal pass fell to him on the edge of the area. He hooked past Myhill and Peterborough celebrated as if they had won. “Some of our lads will have realised this afternoon, just how good they can be,” Westley added.

The Bayern Munich manager, Pep Guardiola, has denied he wants to sign the Chelsea defender David Luiz. The former Barcelona manager said he was more than happy with the squad he has at his disposal, despite the German Super Cup defeat to Borussia Dortmund, in which Bayern lost 4-2. "David Luiz will not be coming to Munich," he said. "I have four, five central defenders who I am very pleased with." The defeat to Dortmund, said the 42-year-old, changes nothing. "There are no excuses for that defeat. We have seen how hard it is to win all the time. We didn't have Franck [Ribéry] and he is a very important player for us. It hurt us that he could not play." Guardiola was speaking ahead of the Audi Cup, which starts on Wednesday. Bayern will be joined by São Paulo, Manchester City and Milan in the pre-season tournament. The Bundesliga starts on 9 August with Bayern facing Borussia Mönchengladbach in the first game of the season.

Right now, the US is edging Mexico The balance of power in Concacaf has tended to edge back and forward between the US and Mexico over the last 20 years, with Mexico generally held to be in the ascendancy – owing primarily to the superiority of their domestic league and the emphasis on youth development, which bore fruit with last year's stunning Olympic win. This year, though, has been an ugly one for El Tri. They've struggled through the Hex phase of qualifying, and since the USA's symbolic win in the Azteca last summer, that stadium has hardly been the fortress of yore. The only surprise about their opening loss to Panama in the Gold Cup group stages was that it wasn't that big a surprise. Even after steadying and going through to the knockout stages, they were pushed all the way by Trinidad and Tobago, before being found wanting yet again by Panama in the semi-finals, as the Panamanians reached their first final since 2005 and ended any hope of a Mexican threepeat over the US. And while Fifa rankings that regularly assert England as world-beaters need always be taken with a pinch of salt, the fact that the US overtook Mexico in the rankings felt about right as an assessment of where both squads are – regardless of the skewing of the stats caused by largely B teams playing in the Gold Cup. Whether they stay there through next year is perhaps not down so much to the US, who are playing as well as could be expected, but how much ground a floundering Mexico can make up with the talent at their disposal. Certainly expect a very awkward inquest for José Manuel 'Chepo' de la Torre on his return to Mexico. Being pelted with cups, as he was after the first Panama loss, may be the least of his worries. There was doubt about him keeping his job even had Mexico retained the Gold Cup. The chances of him being on the sidelines in Brazil look very slim indeed. Can we now regard Honduras part I as a blip? It all seems so long ago now — the opening game of the Hex in Honduras, where the US went down to a defeat that prompted a spiral of soul-searching that reached its nadir just before the infamous Costa Rica snow game. At that point the prospect of a 10-game winning streak for this side looked remote indeed, and the Klinsmann project was being subjected to critical scrutiny and off-the-record briefings to journalists that suggested all was far from well. Not so, insisted Klinsmann this week, calling the first game against Honduras "a blip" on what had otherwise been a steadily upward trajectory over the past two years. The US won the return in a tight game in Utah last month, and on Wednesday night they blew past the Hondurans in imperious style, suggesting there was substance to Klinsmann's claims. The latter game of course was a game largely between players who may be on the fringes of their national teams' first XI (though the incumbent Graham Zusi may have been exhaling particularly hard while watching Landon Donovan's displays in this Gold Cup). And while it seems prudent to take some of the best and worst performances of the national team as outliers when considering where they truly stand, the improvement of those depth players since the particularly awful game against Canada in MLS pre-season is a definite marker for progress. The passing is crisper, the understanding greater, and perhaps most impressively the midfield personnel are able to be rotated without a noticeable loss of fluidity. Beckerman, Holden and Diskerud have all played their part at the base of the midfield, while Bedoya came in for Corona against Honduras and had one of his best games for the US. The ability to change pace and spring defenses is night and day, as both the first two goals against Honduras perfectly illustrated. That idea of players not just as stopgaps, but as active and serviceable depth with an individual understanding of their role and responsibility in the system, is where we can fairly talk about real progress in the US team. It doesn't make the USA world-beaters, but it does mean that compared to just six months ago, or even some of their turgid midfield slogs of 2012, they are certainly a team. Goodson makes a case for himself The consensus at the end of the most recent round of World Cup qualifiers was that the first choice center-back pairing was now Gonzalez and Besler, after the latter had played his way into contention at the start of the year and apparently solved one of the longstanding questions over Klinsmann's selection choices. And when Klinsmann exercised his right to exchange four squad players after the group stages, it was perhaps no surprise to see those two brought in to the squad, presumably to slot straight into the side. Perhaps surprisingly though, only one of those players went into the team – and it wasn't the (barely) more experienced Gonzalez, but the more thoughtful Besler who has stepped in. The other center-back role has been filled by Clarence Goodson, who followed up his first international goal in two years against Guatemala in the tune-up game for the tournament, with the opener against El Salvador in the quarter final – in both cases showing an unlikely predator's instincts in the box. He kept his place against Honduras and continued another trait of recent performances – looking up and trying to get the ball forward quickly. It's precisely what Klinsmann wants from his team, and precisely what they've lacked during the formative part of his reign – players willing to play the percentages and trust that possession per se means less than the number of chances created by forward movement. Goodson has been doing his chances of being one of the four central defenders for Brazil no harm at all. Eddie Johnson has put down a marker It's not exactly "watch the throne" – maybe more "watch the third or fourth in line for the throne", but Klinsmann must be delighted at the heating up of competition for striker spots in his squad. First of all it was Chris Wondolowski who responded to his heels being held to the fire by Jack McInerney's MLS form and inclusion in the Gold Cup squad, by opening his international account with a flurry of goals at the start of this tournament, to keep the young pretender in his place. And then when Eddie Johnson was called into the squad after the group stage, he too wasted no time in sending a message to Wondolowski in turn. Jogging onto the field and heading a goal within seconds to better the efforts of the man he'd replaced was one thing, but having duly claimed the starting spot for the semi-final, Johnson quickly sent another finish with his burst through on goal and emphatic finish to open the scoring. The goal was more than just one that gave the US an early lead – it was a sickener for Honduras. They'd already come out playing with their instinctive conservatism – dropping deep to counter US balls over the top and hoping to spring on the counter to snatch a goal to defend. Johnson's goal confirmed their worst fears about what the game might bring and saw them sink deeper and deeper in the wake of the goal, to the extent that the US defensive midfielders were able to have potshots from near the edge of the box, and the Honduran attack looked negligible. It's possible that Wondolowski would have taken that goal, though when he did eventually come on to the field with a two goal cushion in place, it was hard to escape the feeling that that was about the right order of things – a now proven poacher, with the ability to constantly move and occupy defenses so that they can't commit to helping chase the game, replacing a man more likely to get goals for this team against stronger opposition. 'Overboiling' Jurgen Klinsmann's English is a million times better than my German, and he speaks as he asks his teams to play – without fear. And as Clint Dempsey can testify, occasionally he has harsh words for his own players, though usually within the frame of expecting the absolute best from them. Even after Donovan's standout performances in this tournament Klinsmann was keen to emphasize that he expected more, and had told the player as much: Your benchmark is the best Landon Donovan ever. I'm not taking anything less than that — and he's trying to catch up with that. It's the kind of statement that looks harsher in transcript than it does when delivered in Klinsmann's usual affable manner, where even the most critical comments are delivered with indulgent chuckles. With his self-deprecating interview persona it's easy to forget sometimes that Klinsmann is a fierce competitor, though we got a glimpse of it against Honduras when a furious Klinsmann was ejected after vehemently protesting a foul on Beasley just in front of his technical area. The coach should have known better given the whimsical nature of concacaf refereeing — indeed his outburst had been prompted by it — but after the game he was back to his even self in apologizing ("I just kind of overboiled it"). Under Concacaf Gold Cup rules there isn't an automatic suspension for Klinsmann for the final, and it's possible he will be allowed to take his seat on the bench, depending on the results of a disciplinary enquiry. If he isn't on hand however, this will be an interesting test for the cohesion of the team and possibly an unwelcome distraction from what's been an absolute procession of a tournament so far. But if Klinsmann's claims about the steady upward trajectory of the team are correct, and if the level of understanding is truly what the Gold Cup performances have suggested it is at, then it might perhaps be intriguing to watch this side on autopilot for one game.

Did Panama making the Concacaf Gold Cup final surprise you? It should have. Since the first Gold Cup, in 1991, the tournament has not been kind to smaller teams. Which is to say that out of 11 tournaments, Mexico have won six and the USA have won four. Still, despite the ever-present shadow of those two Goliaths, a few Davids have gone on memorable runs. Here are the best: 1991: Catrachos come oh so close Reading on mobile? Watch this video here In 1991, Concacaf introduced the Gold Cup and, to the shock of many, the USA knocked out Mexico in the semifinal. Even more surprising, though, was the run of Honduras. At the time, the Gold Cup only featured eight teams. The Catrachos actually topped their group ahead of Mexico, thanks to goal difference. In the semifinals, they comfortably beat Costa Rica, 2-0. In the final, they faced a relatively inexperienced US team. The game was tense and scrappy, though only two yellow cards were issued. Both teams lacked the ingenuity in midfield to break down the opposing defense. Even worse, both teams' strikers squandered the handful of chances that were created. Regulation time ended 0-0, as did extra-time. Tired legs and penalty kicks beckoned. The US choked from the spot: only two out of the five kickers converted. But Honduras matched them choke-for-choke. In a moment that still makes my head hurt, each team's sixth kicker failed to convert. In slot seven, Dominic Kinnear held his nerve and scored for the US. So did Honduras' Luis Vallejo. Finally, mercifully, Fernando Clavijo converted for the US and Juan Espinoza did not for Honduras. The US won their first title in the most boring fashion possible: attrition by penalty kick. Conversely, Honduras had come so close – literally a kick of the ball from the title. 2000: Canada claim the crown Nine years later, the US and Mexico were established as tournament favorites. In fact, not even guest Brazil could knock off the North American heavyweights. Rather, the first (and thus far only) team other than the US and Mexico to win the Gold Cup was none other than Canada. Somewhat oddly, Canada only advanced out of the group stages by coin toss. What? Yes, that's right. All their group games ended in ties. As in, every team tied every other team. Costa Rica topped the group thanks to goals scored (they also conceded the most goals). So Canada and South Korea flipped a coin for second place. Canada called correctly, and advanced to the quarterfinals. They then pulled off an upset for the ages, beating Mexico 2-1 thanks to dramatic late goals by Carlo Corazzin and Richard Hastings (in extra-time). Canada then breezed by Trinidad &amp; Tobago in the semifinals and easily beat an understrength Colombia side in the final. Many fans scratched their heads and asked why Colombia accepted an invitation but did not field a strong roster. Regardless, Corazzin finished as the top scorer and the tournament MVP was the Canadian goalie, Craig Forrest, who at various times had saved some Canadian bacon. 2002: Ticos tempt the fates Only two years later, another dark horse made a serious run. This time Costa Rica took a shot at the giants of Concacaf, after easily winning a group featuring Trinidad &amp; Tobago and Martinique. In the quarterfinals they squeezed by Haiti 2-1, thanks to a late goal by Ronald Gomez. In the semifinals, they breezed by special guest South Korea to the tune of 3-0. However, in the final their luck ran out. They lost to the US 2-0, conceding goals to Josh Wolff and Jeff Agoos. The Ticos have reached the semis twice since, but haven't yet tasted another title game. 2005: Canaleros come up short Reading on mobile? Watch this video here Panama did not appear poised for a deep run. In the group stages, they tied a game, lost a game and won a game – finishing second, behind Honduras. Yes, striker Luis Tejada was in scintillating form and had three goals in three games, but the defense looked leaky. In the quarterfinals, they advanced past guest nation South Africa on penalty kicks after a 1-1 draw. Then, in the semi-finals, they beat another guest nation, Colombia, 3-2 in a barnstormer of a game. In the final, they faced a young and confident US team. The game plan was simple: pack the box and defend with numbers. A 3 o'clock kick-off in stifling July heat helped. The Canaleros effectively neutralized the US danger man, Landon Donovan, and the game ended 0-0. However, they couldn't keep their nerve from the spot. Kasey Keller saved Luis Tejada's opening penalty, a low shot to the corner, and the tone was set. Only one Canalero converted while Santino Quaranta, Landon Donovan and Brad Davis scored for the US, who won the title yet again thanks to spot kicks. 2013: Year of the dark horse? The 2013 Panama team should take heart: dark horses have been to the title game before. However, glory for such teams is by definition fleeting. Can they match Canada's feat in 2000, or will they repeat the heartbreak of 2005?

Yeovil Town have confirmed the signing of Swansea City defender Alan Tate … by posting a message on an easel outside Huish Park in their own version of the Royal baby announcement. "Yeovil Town Football Club was safely delivered of a loan defender at 1pm today," read the message. "Alan Tate from Swansea City has signed until 2 January 2014." The official announcement of the birth of the royal baby was posted on a gold-coloured easel outside Buckingham Palace on Monday night. Failing to sign a Celtic player appears a missed opportunity, however; the Championship club could then at least have announced: "It's a Bhoy."

IT HAPPENS TO US ALL The past few seasons have taken their toll on Chelsea's once loveable litso. First, there were the dark spots under the eyes from the bunch of FA tw@ts incident. Then there were a few wrinkles after the unsubstantiated r@cism accusations aimed at Mark Clattenburg. And, of course, there was growth of grey hair upon discovering that England's Brave John Terry was now just Plain Old John Terry. These tell-tale signs of ageing mean that instead of enjoying the summer sunshine, rich Uncle Roman has been locked indoors trembling and twitching, having difficulty swallowing and biting his nails quicker than the Fiver devours a bag of Tayto salt and vinegar. A man of his standing cannot have his trophy team smelling of Tesco Everyday Value Brandy and looking like they have spent the night retrieving their undies from a tree. No, no, no. He needs it nipped and tucked and spicked and spanned and ready to blind all ahead with its beauty. Gone was the paunch of the previous waiter and in came a slimline, classic cut. Snip went the surgeon's scalpel around the flabby excess of the Paulo Ferreiras and Henrique Hilários and in its place came the taut youth of André Schürrle and, um, Mark Schwarzer. But still rich Uncle Roman isn't happy. He is still fidgeting and he still feels the club needs one more addition, one more beauty spot, one Luis Suárez. Now, said Suárez is no stranger to Fiver frivolity and so there is no need for the Fiver to sink its teeth into those grand old gags about him. But the possible move for the Uruguayan does raise one question: what does Branislav Ivanovic feel about all this? "I said straight after the game, whatever happened on the field finished there. He's one of the best strikers in the Premier League. I don't have any problem with him," straight-faced the defender through gritted teeth, forgetting about the time he, eh, refused to accept the apology Of course, if this transfer were to go through, it wouldn't be the first time that Chelsea have shelled out some big money to Liverpool for one of their strikers and that one worked out pretty well for them, right?

Luis Suárez will be told by Liverpool to train away from the squad until he shows a better attitude, with his angry manager, Brendan Rodgers, accusing him of showing a "total disrespect of the club". Rodgers rejected Suárez's claim that the striker was promised a move this summer if Liverpool did not qualify for the Champions League and, in a further setback for the Uruguayan, the Professional Footballers' Association has concluded that there is no clause in his contract guaranteeing him a move for £40m. Suárez's public outburst against Liverpool, in an interview with the Guardian, has backfired on him, with the order to train away from the squad effectively signalling that he has become an outcast because of his desire to leave for Arsenal and what Rodgers regards as a lack of respect for the club and his team-mates. The manager said Suárez must publicly apologise before he can be considered for playing again. "There were no promises made – categorically none – and no promises broken," Rodgers said on Wednesdaynight. "The club and his representatives had several conversations and he knew exactly where he was at. "I think Luis knows the support he's had at the football club and that's something that's been unswerving throughout the whole of last season. Obviously the remarks I've read are bitterly disappointing but my job is bigger than that. My job is to fight and protect the club. "I will take strong, decisive action, absolutely. There has been total disrespect of the club – this is a lack of respect of a club that has given him everything, absolutely everything. I don't believe there is a clause in his contract that says he can leave for any sort of price." Suárez says he is prepared to make his desire to leave official by lodging a formal transfer request by the end of this week but Rodgers reiterated that Liverpool will sell only for the "correct value", believed to be more than £50m. Questioned about Suárez playing for the club again, the manager said: "There's a few bridges to cross before that can happen. It's about the respect – that's the only thing we look for. This is one of the most iconic football clubs in the world, you can't disrespect it." Of an apology he added: "That's something I will ensure before anything happens in the future." Arsenal remain in line to sign Suárez should he force through his wish, with Arsène Wenger describing the club as being "on standby" as they continue to wait for what they hope will be a decisive twist to the saga. They made a £40,000,001 bid more than two weeks ago and are pleased that Suárez has gone public. They will also wait to see how the possible legal challenges play out, with the striker having stated he will ask the Premier League to arbitrate. The League is yet to be contacted by the player. Gordon Taylor, the PFA's chief executive, said: "If you are going to have a supposed buyout clause, it should be that but it is different as it says, 'If there is no qualification for the Champions League and if there is a minimum offer of £40m, then the parties will get around the table to discuss things.' But it does not say the club has to sell. It quite clearly states £40m is a minimum offer for discussions but it becomes really difficult with such clauses. "There is a 'good-faith clause' in relation to serious discussions but I can't say it is a cast-iron buyout clause. ""Luis is one of our members and we want to be supportive. However, he may well have thought such an offer would trigger a move. "The interpretation is not that simple and there is no guarantee of getting a result if it is referred to the Premier League. I just feel like in any other transfer it is better for both parties to get around the table to try to resolve it. At the moment it is certainly festering and I don't think it is a good situation for the player or the clubs involved. It is not edifying, that is why I feel we had to do our best to get round the table and see if there are grounds for consideration for the move but it [the clause] is not specific and 100% certain." The problem for Arsenal would appear to be that any outcome to the dispute could run beyond the transfer deadline of 2 September. Their fallback option is to increase the offer, which they have the will and capacity to do. "At the moment, the situation is on standby," Wenger said. "I heard that [Suárez is considering legal action], but this is sometimes linked with things that you don't know as a potential buyer. That is the story between Suárez and Liverpool and I don't know what has been said, what has been promised and what has been written and that is only Suárez and Liverpool that can decide that. "It is nothing to do with us. We have been told that the player wants to leave Liverpool and that is why we have acted. I really don't know what will be decided by Liverpool."

Chelsea have instantly rejected a £35m bid from Barcelona for David Luiz. The La Liga champions lodged the offer for the 26-year-old late on Tuesday but José Mourinho has told them to forget about signing the Brazilian or anyone else from Stamford Bridge. The manager sees David Luiz as a core member of the squad with which he intends to take the Premier League title from Manchester United and says he has no interest in selling his best players. The player, who arrived from Benfica in January 2011 for £21m, has been earmarked as an untouchable by Mourinho – along with Oscar, Juan Mata and Eden Hazard. Furthermore the Chelsea manager believes it will be impossible to replace a player of the Brazil defender's stature with the new season less than two weeks away, meaning there is no chance of the defender moving on. David Luiz endured some shaky moments at the start of his Chelsea career but has recovered to become an integral part of a defence which will have John Terry and Gary Cahill, who have impressed on their tour of the United States, vying for a starting slot. Mourinho said this week: "David has come back with us fantastically and we have to use his quality. He has big self-confidence and self-esteem, especially when he comes up from the back with the ball. Can he improve defensively? Of course. But it is my job to try always to improve players." The defender, who has also attracted interest from Bayern Munich, sat out Chelsea's match with Milan in New Jersey on Sunday with a hamstring strain that also forced him out of Wednesday'sgame with Real Madrid. Mourinho has been enthused with the prospect of building a younger, more vibrant side than the one he created during his first spell at Chelsea and is keen to add to, not reduce, the numbers in his squad. Chelsea will finish off their US tour on Saturday with a game against Roma in Washington DC, where they have been based for the past week. David Luiz insisted earlier this summer that he had no intention of leaving and was quick to state his desire to remain at Stamford Bridge and play for Mourinho. Being mentioned as a possible makeweight in any deal to bring Wayne Rooney to Stamford Bridge has also caused the Brazilian disquiet. The news that he will remain follows Mata's announcement following clear-the-air talks with the Chelsea hierarchy recentlyin which he was assured of his role as a key member of the squad and that he would not be sold for any price.

Liverpool have issued members of staff with a list of "unacceptable" words and phrases in their efforts to combat all forms of discrimination at Anfield. The guide, part of a wider education programme run by the club, details terms that employees should deem offensive under the headings of race/religion, sexual orientation, gender and disability. Most are self-explanatory and the guide advises that it is "important to understand the context of what's being said", as in the use, under gender for example, of "princess" or "don't be a woman" on the Anfield terraces next season. Liverpool's list of what is "usually offensive and the club considers unacceptable" has been given to all full-time and casual members of staff who have contact with the public on matchdays or on a daily basis. The club were widely criticised for their support of Luis Suárez when the striker was found guilty in December 2011 of having used racially abusive language towards Patrice Evra but view their education programme as one of several proactive measures taken to combat discrimination. The guide has not been issued to Liverpool players because they, along with players at all Premier League and Football League clubs, receive separate guidance from the Football Association. Rishi Jain, the social inclusion officer for Liverpool who helped compile the guide, said: "As part of the club's continued commitment to tackle all forms of discrimination, as well as promoting its approach to equality and diversity, Liverpool FC have been actively engaged in a full club-wide education and awareness programme. "This programme includes interactive workshops and a handbook which is designed to provide information on the latest equality legislation including information relating to what terminology is deemed as both acceptable and unacceptable. This programme of awareness enables our employees to recognise inappropriate language and take the necessary steps to ensure Anfield is free from all forms of discrimination." Liverpool became the first Premier League club to be represented at a UK Pride event last August. Jain said: "Liverpool have been actively working with Kick it Out, Show Racism the Red Card and the Anthony Walker Foundation for many years and has been recognised externally for its contribution to helping tackle discrimination and promote Anfield as an inclusive and welcoming environment. "The club has already attained Kick it Out's equality standard preliminary level and has recently submitted its application for the equality standard intermediate level demonstrating its continued commitment." Liverpool's guide has been praised by Lord Ouseley, the chair of Kick It Out. He said: "Kick It Out acknowledges the great strides that Liverpool FC have taken over recent times to reiterate their continued commitment to equality. The guide forms part of an overall awareness programme, and is a positive and proactive step in educating staff and stewards at the club. "Match day stewards must be trained on dealing with incidents of discrimination and unacceptable behaviour in order to eradicate it from our stadiums, and more and more football clubs are using Kick It Out's Equality Standard as a framework to develop this education across all areas of the business."

As ever in the selection of World Cup squads, there are excellent players whose presence, for one reason or another, is deemed unsuitable – whether for reasons of form, fitness or face. And with several squads not yet finalised, waiting to be pruned from 30 to 23, for some there awaits disappointment yet more crushing – not only will they miss out on a trip to Brazil but are also ineligible for the Guardian's Surplus to Requirements XI: Diego López Initially a beneficiary of José Mourinho's appetite for a fight, Diego López has retained his spot in the Real Madrid goal, even under Carlo Ancelotti. But at international level, Iker Casillas, the man he superseded, remains Vicente del Bosque's preference, and with Pepe Reina and David De Gea also available his omission barely weakens the squad, while allowing the captain the security of certainty, Rafael da Silva A player of undoubted attitude and ability, the Brazilian had finally harnessed both – last season, his performances were notable solely for their consistent excellence. But, following the arrival of a manager who clearly did not rate him, his confidence and performances plummeted. John Mensah Though past his best, it was nonetheless surprising when Mensah – a former Black Stars captain – was dropped by the Ghana manager, Kwesi Appiah. He was not expected to start games, but his leadership and calmness would have been useful, given a youthful squad and taxing group. Miranda Despite playing a crucial role at Atlético Madrid, in one of Europe's strongest and best-organised defences, Miranda was ignored by the Brazil coach, Luiz Felipe Scolari. More peculiarly still, alongside Thiago Silva will be either David Luiz or Dante, neither of whom is remotely as reliable. Ashley Cole Competing against England in the group stages are three pacy and inventive attacking sides – but, nonetheless, the ability to cross and take free-kicks has been deemed of greater value than fast running and resourceful defending. As such, Leighton Baines, aged 29 and with zero Champions League games to his credit, has been preferred to Ashley Cole as first choice, with Luke Shaw a sensible choice as back-up. The right-wingers of Costa Rica, Italy and Uruguay are unlikely to experience much in the way of trepidation. Gareth Barry Perennially underrated and underappreciated, Barry has enjoyed an excellent season for Everton – one far better than that of Frank Lampard at Chelsea and Michael Carrick at Manchester United, both of whom have been selected ahead of him, albeit the latter is only on standby. A perceptive passer with the ability to shoot from distance, Barry has the rare ability to elevate the players around him and is perhaps better suited to his position than Steven Gerrard, the man who will fill it for England in Brazil. Ander Herrera Another influential season for Athletic Bilbao was not sufficient to earn Herrera a holiday in Brazil. Such is the strength of Spanish football – despite its lack of a St George's Park facility with underwater treadmills – that the exclusion of exceptional talents for the Spanish national team is inevitable but, even so, Herera is unfortunate to miss out. Samir Nasri Didier Deschamps' exclusion of Samir Nasri from his France squad left the world in the rather uncomfortable position of deeming the tweets of a footballer's girlfriend to be news. But, Anara Atanes – that's the Anara Atanes – was not at all happy. And it is unlikely that Nasri was either, given his excellent season for Manchester City, one in which he has made a significant improvement in both manner and performance. But Deschamps remained unimpressed by his performances at international level and, not considering him a likely starter, felt unable to rely on his goodwill and co-operation as a reserve. Isco A player so good that his arrival precipitated the sale of Mesut Özil, Isco's season at Madrid has been mixed. He began well but the form of Luka Modric and Ángel di María gradually nudged him out of the reckoning and, given Spain's humiliation of playmaking riches, his omission was not the shock it might once have been. Iker Muniaín Yet another imaginative, improvisational Spaniard, Muniaín is also fast and adroit. And his form this season has been excellent, along with that of Herrera, a significant factor in Bilbao's champions league qualification. But, such is the competition, he has been awarded only one international cap and although would he would probably be an automatic choice in every other squad, was never going to make Spain's. Carlos Tevez Despite Brazil's relative proximity to his daughter in Argentina, there was no place for Tevez in Alejandro Sabella's World Cup squad. It is true that he can call upon Sergio Agüero, Lionel Messi, Gonzalo Higuaín and Ezequiel Lavezzi but the presence in the provisional list of Rodrigo Palacio and, in particular, Franco Di Santo, remains strange. Subs John Ruddy Despite playing for Norwich – a relegated side that conceded 62 league goals – Ruddy also kept 12 clean sheets and has been named in every single England squad since the European Championship. But Fraser Forster and Ben Foster – who has previously retired from international football, offended by his lack of unearned opportunities – were selected to be Joe Hart's deputies. Ruddy was particularly disappointed by the failure of nepotism upon which he had relied: Dave Watson, England's goalkeeping coach, is also Norwich's. "I've only worked with Dave for the last two years and now I'm not in the World Cup squad. It doesn't sit very well," he said. Filipe Luís Another player who has had an exceptional season with Atlético Madrid – and another likely to be plundered by plutocrats too impatient to develop their own talent. But competition at left-back is tough and while he is arguably a superior defender to both Maxwell and Marcelo, he is not as effective going forward. Marc Bartra Rated very highly at Barcelona, Bartra has made 25 appearances this season, most recently seizing the chance afforded him by an injury to Gerard Piqué and scoring against Real Madrid in the Copa del Rey final. Given Spain's relative weakness at centre-back and the likelihood of his soon becoming a regular, Del Bosque could have done worse than find him a space. Asier Illarramendi Yet to make his international debut, Illarramendi is the most expensive Spaniard ever purchased by Real Madrid. Strong in the tackle and adept at anticipating danger, the defensive midfielder is also a clever passer and mover, able to relieve pressure and start attacks. Javier Pastore A sublime talent, Pastore has yet to find an accompanying consistency. Although his season with Paris Saint-Germain was punctuated by brilliance beyond the reach of most others, it was largely disappointing, and as such, insufficient to earn him a place in the Argentina squad. Mario Gomez Despite damaging knee ligaments in March, Gomez's exclusion from Germany's provisional squad was surprising. He has resumed training and, given its dearth of strikers – a deficiency already exposed in this season's Champions League – that Joachim Löw could find no role for him, even as a substitute, may prove to be an error.

Roy Hodgson has described leaving Ashley Cole out of his World Cup squad as "one of the hardest decisions of my career," after breaking the news in a telephone call that prompted the defender to announce his retirement from international football. Cole informed the England manager he had no intention of going on the standby list after losing his place to the 18-year-old Luke Shaw in a 23-man squad that will also feature Ross Barkley instead of Michael Carrick, placing a heavy emphasis on younger players. Cole's 107 caps put him fifth in England's all-time appearances list but Hodgson told the 33-year-old he was preparing a squad that also had the 2016 European Championship in mind and planned to use Leighton Baines as his first-choice left-back, with Shaw in reserve because of his outstanding performances for Southampton. "I got the call from Roy and agree the England team should be about the young players," Cole said. "I think it best I retire from [the] England team now. We have a great manager and team and I wish them only success. I will be supporting them like a true fan. Thanks to everyone for everything. Baines and Shaw are great players, [as] proved this season, and are the future of this country. It was a pleasure to get 107 caps." Hodgson described Cole as "an incredible competitor for England" and will fully explain his decision when the squad is announced at 2pm on Monday. "Among many difficult decisions I've had to make for my squad, not selecting Ashley was one of the hardest," Hodgson said. "To amass over a century of caps is a truly staggering achievement and he deserves enormous credit for the desire and brilliance which has shone through over the years he has represented his country. There are few players who can be considered among the very best in the world, but Ashley in his prime was the best left-back without question." Hodgson added: "The most important factor was speaking to Ashley prior to the announcement. He deserved to hear it directly from me and he took the news with huge grace. In two years working with him he has shown nothing but relentless professionalism, and a great hunger to play for England. He is someone I have the utmost respect for and I wished him all the best. He, in turn, wished the team well this summer. Of course I must respect his decision to retire, he has been one of England's finest players, but I want to look to the future. It has been one of the hardest decisions of my career." Hodgson was prepared for Cole to decline his place on the standby list and is expected to bring in Jon Flanagan, rather than Kieran Gibbs, to fill the void, on the basis that he can operate on either flank. Flanagan would become the sixth Liverpool player after Steven Gerrard, Raheem Sterling, Daniel Sturridge, Jordan Henderson and Glen Johnson among the 30. Hodgson was at Southampton to watch the 1-1 draw with Manchester United and Shaw excelled again. However, it is also apparent Hodgson's mind was made up a few months ago, as Cole was increasingly marginalised at Chelsea. Shaw will be joined by Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert among Southampton's contingent. Jack Wilshere will also be included after returning from a nine-week lay-off in Arsenal's 2-0 win at Norwich on Sunday. Wilshere came through his comeback from a broken foot with no problems and Arsène Wenger said: "The World Cup is one month away, that's plenty of time. It just shows you he has no problem to be available." The Arsenal manager also reported that Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is close to returning to full training and in contention for Saturday's FA Cup final against Hull City. "The news is good. He should re-integrate into our squad for normal training. He is available to Roy and I wouldn't be surprised if he is picked." Hodgson's ring-around to his various players also included trying to get hold of Andy Carroll only to find the West Ham striker had already left for an end-of-season holiday. Carroll, nonetheless, is expected to be on the standby list and John Stones has also emerged as a contender after his performances for Everton over the second half of the season.

Gareth Bale touched the ball to his team-mate and he blasted into his stride. The run took him from the edge of his own penalty area; the kind of sortie he had trademarked at Tottenham Hotspur and, before that, at Southampton. On Tuesday night, it came in the decorated colours of Real Madrid. Against Bayern Munich. In Bavaria. In the Champions League semi-final second leg. Ángel di María found Karim Benzema and Benzema moved it back to Bale who, by now, having crossed halfway, had the pistons pumping. Bale charged past Bayern's last defender, Jerome Boateng, and, passing up the shot for himself, he worked the ball square to Cristiano Ronaldo, who finished low past Manuel Neuer. As the ever-understated Ronaldo went into his pre-planned routine to remind the global audience that it was his 15th Champions League goal of the season from ten ties – to eclipse Lionel Messi's record – Bale might have pinched himself. Real were 3-0 up on the night, in the backyard of the defending champions, and set for a 4-0 triumph that would take them through, by an aggregate scoreline of 5-0, to their first Champions League final in 12 years. Bale had won the Copa Del Rey two weeks previously – the first major honour of his career – when his sensational individual goal had made the difference against Barcelona. The La Liga title is not out of the question for him, either. Real trail the leaders, Atlético Madrid, by six points but they have a game in hand. Bale has 20 goals in all competitions and he has found his groove over the second half of the season, when it matters the most. He is revelling on Europe's grandest stages. So Gareth, any regrets about that transfer last summer? "I do think of the journey I have made," Bale said, after the slaying of Bayern, and the mind went back to him as a small and spindly 15-year-old who, it was feared, might lack the physique to make it in the game. There was also the career-threatening ankle injury at 18, the year of his move from Southampton to Tottenham, plus the thing about him being a jinx for the London club, when he failed to taste victory in 24 Premier League appearances. Harry Redknapp, the manager at the time, was open to selling him. Bale, though, is not somebody who lingers too long on what has gone, or on anything that is overly sentimental. The 24-year-old lives for the "here and now", as he said on more than one occasion at the Allianz Arena late on Tuesday night, and the here and now is loaded with possibilities for him. Chief among them is La Décima, the capture of a 10th European Cup, something that has obsessed Real with burgeoning intensity since the Zinedine Zidane-inspired ninth triumph over Bayer Leverkusen in 2002. Real have chewed through 10 managers and £905m in transfer fees in the quest for their holy grail and Bale, the world record £86m signing from Tottenham, now stands to help them to it. He could succeed where many previous galácticos have failed. "When I signed, I was told all about La Décima and what it means to the club," Bale said. "There is a lot of expectation at Real but there is more expectation about that. We are happy to be in the final now, happy to have the chance of actually winning it." Bale had said upon his presentation as a Real player last September that he hoped "to be able to help the club to win La Décima". He said it in Spanish and it got the desired cheers from the fans in attendance. As with each of his high-profile and expensive predecessors, he has been signed to win the Champions League. The pressure is unforgiving. And yet Bale has embraced it. "Real Madrid is just the most massive club," Bale said, a trace of awe in his voice. "No matter who it is and where you are, everybody wants to beat Real Madrid. The expectation here is absolutely huge but we all thrive on the pressure. We certainly did against Bayern. "We have performed unbelievably all season and now we have one more game to go. Everyone who comes to Real Madrid wants to win the Champions League and now we have a real chance to do it." Bale talked of the 4-0 dismantling of Bayern as being "the perfect game" and, having found his rhythm, he appears perfectly suited to the manager Carlo Ancelotti's style, which is defined by speed on the counterattack and ruthless execution. It was difficult for Bale at first, and not because of the weight of his fee. He missed the whole of pre-season as his move from Tottenham became protracted and then a little bit ugly, and he did not complete 90 minutes for Real until 30 October against Sevilla. That game was only his third start for the club. "Missing pre-season affected me massively," Bale said. "I didn't realise how important a pre-season was until I came to Madrid. It took a little while for me to get going, which I think everyone understood. But I have been able to really kick on after Christmas, to get my fitness up and play well. "I try not to think about the fee. I came to Madrid to play football and I am enjoying that. If I think about that and nothing else, then I know that I'll play well." Ancelotti believes that Bale will be more consistent over his second season at the club but, for the player, it is all about the moment, the closing weeks of this season. "I'm sure that all of the family will want tickets for the Champions League final," Bale said, with a smile. He has begun to fulfil his dreams.

Before anyone accuses this so-called Gang of Three of sour grapes, just imagine the fuss if it was one of the clubs competing for the title that had fielded an ineligible player and escaped a points deduction. Imagine if it was Manchester City with Fernandinho, or Chelsea with Willian, or Liverpool with Mamadou Sakho, rather than Sunderland and Ji Dong-won. Then consider the way the piped music of the Premier League would have turned into a heavy metal moshpit. There would have been uproar. Alternatively, drop down to the other end of football to understand a little more about why Norwich, Cardiff and Fulham believe Sunderland were let off too lightly in the Ji case and have instructed lawyers to take it up with the league. Look at what has happened to AFC Wimbledon over the past week, docked three points for fielding an ineligible player. Or the mother of all punishments that left Altrincham, an even smaller club, on their knees a few years ago. At their level, Altrincham will always struggle to be heard above the din of the higher leagues. Yet it is some story. As one campaigner wrote in a letter to the Football Association at the time: "Altrincham's crime was not to cheat, nor was it to engage deliberately in any type of misconduct, it was simply to sign an English footballer from another English club in good faith." The player in question, a Liverpudlian by the name of James Robinson, had been scouted playing for Accrington Stanley reserves. What Altrincham did not know was that he had previously had a short spell at IVB, an Icelandic club, and that meant they needed international clearance. A cross was marked in the box when it should have been a tick. Accrington were fined £250 but nothing more because he never played in their first team. Altrincham were not so lucky. The 18-point deduction is the highest doled out for this kind of offence – and it meant automatic relegation from the Conference. As Geoff Goodwin, Altrincham's chairman at the time, remembers it: "It ripped out my heart." They were reinstated the following season because Scarborough were demoted for breaching financial rules and Canvey Island withdrew from the league. That, however, is not the point, and it is not too difficult to guess what they make of Sunderland getting off with a fine from the Premier League for not having Ji's international clearance. Goodwin's take on it, when we spoke a few days ago, was short and to the point. "The football authorities in this country look at the smaller clubs and just stand on them," he said. It is tempting to wonder what they make of it at Oxford City, too, bearing in mind they were docked three points in March after fielding a player they did not realise should have been suspended and have just been relegated from Conference North – by two points. For them, there has been no Altrincham-style reprieve and there is already a human cost. The manager, Mike Ford, has just been informed that dropping down a division has cost him his job. On it goes. Harrogate Town, another Conference North club run by a skeleton staff, were docked three points in September for fielding three players in a match when their registrations had not been completed properly. Wimbledon's case came about because a virus had closed down the club's offices. The member of staff who was meant to sign off the forms was ill and the message never reached the team's manager. Another genuine mistake and, again, one that had to be punished. It is not that these clubs have lost points that is strange. It is that, higher in the leagues, another club kept all theirs. "All you want is some level of consistency," Goodwin says. "Instead, it's one rule for one and one for another. That's unfair." And he is right. That is partly what has compelled Norwich and Cardiff to bring Fulham on board and start exploring the possibilities of legal action. They will inevitably be accused of meddling and it is easy to imagine it being thrown back at them – with a degree of justification – that if they wanted to stay in the league they should have won more games rather than relying on one of their rivals losing points through an administrative error. Equally, they are entitled to fair play and openness and there is something profoundly unsatisfactory about the way Sunderland's breach of rules B14.5 and U11 was handled. There has never been any explanation about why the relevant authorities were so keen to keep it schtum. These stories always come out sooner or later and the attempt at secrecy created the suspicion there was something to hide. Memo to Richard Scudamore: this is an industry that finds it almost impossible to keep a secret. Sunderland cite the fact that three of the four league games in which Ji played were defeats. Yet who thought up this theory that playing badly should mean getting away with it? The club have still broken the rules over a sustained period, no matter how their games panned out. Every case is different, naturally, but Gus Poyet is correct when he says there should be a clear punishment that everyone knows. There is for falling into administration, or racism, or any manner of other offences – just not for fielding an ineligible player. For the record, Sunderland drew 1-1 at Southampton when Ji was a second-half substitute, and they also beat Milton Keynes Dons 4-2 in the second round of the Capital One Cup. Sunderland were losing 2-0 when the South Korea international was substituted after 49 minutes but, again, that is missing the point. The Football League had the option to throw Sunderland out of the cup. Instead, a fine was issued, followed by another pact of secrecy, and Sunderland went all the way to the final, earning an awful lot more money than they were made to hand over in return. So what happens So what happens next? My suspicion is that the Gang of Three will ultimately become a Gang of One (whoever finishes third from bottom) if Sunderland stay up. Poyet described his team as needing a "miracle" after losing 5-1 at Spurs last month but, since then, they have thrashed Cardiff, come within two minutes of winning at Manchester City and been the first-ever team to condemn José Mourinho's Chelsea to defeat at Stamford Bridge. The 1-0 win at Manchester United on Sunday leaves them three points clear of the relegation zone with two home games to follow against West Brom and Swansea. The miracle is almost complete. But it is not just Norwich, Cardiff and Fulham who consider it unfair. Steve Bruce and Sam Allardyce, the managers of Hull and West Ham respectively, have said the same. Other clubs, such as West Brom, have expressed concerns. A few miles from the Stadium of Light, Seaham Red Star were automatically docked three points by the Northern League this season because of a mix-up concerning the forms for a loaned player. To recap, this is what the league's chairman, Mike Amos, said of the registration process: "Sometimes it's not just a wrong 'un but a right wrong 'un – a deliberate attempt at cheating. On other occasions it's the result of an innocent and unfortunate mistake." Seaham, he said, fell into the second category, but the deduction was mandatory so it would not "leave us open to allegations of bias or worse". It is a shame the Premier League did not have a more defined system because what we have now is getting messy. It also has the potential to become a great deal messier and, when staying in the top division is worth tens of millions of pounds every year, nobody should really be surprised it has come to this.

Manchester City finally produced the flying start to a Champions League campaign they have been seeking. After drawing against Napoli and losing to Real Madrid in their two previous opening group games, Manuel Pellegrini's team departed the home of the Czech Republic champions with a convincing victory and all three points. A second-half goal burst from Edin Dzeko, Yaya Touré and Sergio Agüero did the business, though there is still work to be done for the new manager as he seeks to plot a path through the opening phase of the competition proper, a feat never managed by his predecessor, Roberto Mancini. "Yes, I think it's very important to start the Champions League winning away, it was not an easy match. Plzen are a very good team and to win 3-0 away, I'm very happy," Pellegrini said. "In the first half we had clear chances to score also but didn't do it. In the second half we had more speed to our play and that was very important against a team that had 10 players behind the ball. In the second half we finished what we started at the end of the first half but with two or three differences." This is the perfect way to lead into Sunday's visit to the Etihad Stadium of Manchester United for the opening derby of the season. With Vincent Kompany coming through the match unscathed, the next wish for Pellegrini is that Gaël Clichy and David Silva can also return from their respective thigh and knee problems to give the manager the best chance of recording a win over the champions and register a significant early psychological blow over their cross-town rivals. The manager said: "We'll see – from the report I had today David Silva could maybe arrive in the derby, Clichy more difficult. Vincent Kompany played 90 minutes without any problem – I had some doubts in the last 15 minutes to change him but he said he [was] OK. Micah [Richards] will work normally from tomorrow [following a hamstring injury] so there's no problem. And Agüero had took a little knock but he is fine." City had been sluggish for passages against Plzen, again lacking the spark missing for most of last season. The sight of Jesús Navas being withdrawn after the break following an ineffective display summed this up, though Pellegrini will hardly grumble at the outcome of a contest in which the result was all important. While the Chilean maintains the Premier League has equal status for the club, Pellegrini's pedigree in this competition was a principal factor in his appointment as manager, the desire being he can right a wrong that a £1bn-plus investment has so far failed to address. He now hopes his side can grow into a season that had so far stuttered, as they did into this game. "It will give confidence to all the players. We also have the derby next Sunday so winning away in the Champions League and scoring three goals, having three or four more chances to score and keeping a clean sheet, always gives you a lot of confidence," said Pellegrini. As the half-hour passed, the tale had been of a laboured City going the closer to opening the scoring with only the odd scare on Joe Hart's goal. Kompany provided one of these with a back-pass from near halfway that sold his keeper short and forced Hart into a sliding clearance with a boot. Before this, City were unlucky not to take the lead through a series of chances of which at least one should have been converted. Navas, lining up on the right of a fluid 4-1-3-2, began these with a shot from the flank that was tipped over for the first corner by Matus Kozacik, the home keeper. Samir Nasri delivered the ensuing dead ball on to Dzeko's head and his flick-on demanded to be finished by Touré. Instead, the Ivorian's header found only the roof of the Plzen net. The best of the visitors' chances came in quick succession. Agüero skated through the home midfield and, as a gap opened up, the forward unloaded a strike that skimmed across the turf, beyond Kozacik, only to rebound off his right post. Aleksandar Kolarov, in at left-back for Clichy, took aim with his left foot but could only hit the ball into Kozacik's hands. Kolarov also created a prime opening for Dzeko with a cross from his wing that found the No10 at point-blank range from the Plzen keeper, but Kozacik beat the header away. Throughout the stanza Plzen found joy through the left boot of Pavel Horvath, their 38-year-old captain, who exposed City's vulnerability whenever he swung a high delivery into their area. Yet 12 minutes into the second half victory was secured as City transformed the score into a three-nil advantage. First, Agüero outmuscled Lukas Hejda near halfway, remaining on his feet when he might have gone down to continue on to goal before unselfishly rolling the ball sideways to Dzeko, who blasted the ball past Kozacik. The second came from Touré, the Ivorian producing a curling shot from 20 yards that the keeper could not stop. Agüero finally had the strike his display deserved when a neat swivel was followed by a finish that gave his side an impregnable lead as he and the rest of Pellegrini's team could relax.

Arsenal touched down in the south of France in confident mood as they aim to start the Champions League group stage with a 10th successive away win in all competitions, but the lack of depth in their squad has become a genuine concern for Arsène Wenger and his players. Olivier Giroud, who has given Arsenal a major boost by declaring himself fit to start against Marseille on Wednesday night, admitted he is "a bit scared" about the paucity of Wenger's options and predicted problems ahead. Although Wenger can name a strong starting XI against the French runners-up, including Mesut Özil, the substitutes' bench looks threadbare in the absence of Mikel Arteta, Lukas Podolski, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Santi Cazorla, Tomas Rosicky, Yaya Sanogo and Abou Diaby, all of whom remain injured. "We're a really united squad and everyone works for the team," said Giroud, who was struggling with a knee injury after Saturday's 3-1 victory at Sunderland. "That's good, we have a quality squad but I'm a bit scared about the numbers we have in the squad. We will face problems because of the numbers in our squad. But we'll do everything we can to rival the big clubs." Wenger admitted he harbours his own worries. "For Marseille, all the players who had little doubts are OK. But I am concerned because we play now for two months every three or four days and it's important to get some players back, because you cannot play for the next two months with the squad we have at the moment." As well as Giroud, Wenger is able to call upon Per Mertesacker, who missed the Sunderland match through illness. The Germany international is likely to be restored to central defence, with Carl Jenkinson dropping to the bench and Bacary Sagna moving to right-back, as Arsenal attempt to continue their remarkable form on their travels, which started with a 2-0 victory over Bayern Munich in the Allianz Arena in March, when they were eliminated from the Champions League on away goals. Since that unexpected triumph against the German champions, Arsenal have gone on to win away from home against Swansea, West Brom, Fulham (twice), Queens Park Rangers, Newcastle, Fenerbahce and Sunderland, scoring 18 times and conceding only three. "We're an exceptional team, that is the main thing," Mertesacker said. "We built that up from last season. We built our confidence up, especially the 10 games at the end of last season where we did not lose. You could feel it from the first day that there is something special, apart from the first game [against Aston Villa when Arsenal lost 3-1]. But nobody dropped and the performance went well after that as well. We have showed we are ready to keep our run going." Stade Vélodrome, which resembles a building site with major work going on to redevelop the ground before the 2016 European Championships, would be a good place to make it 10 straight away wins. Marseille are no pushovers – they are fourth in Ligue 1 and have five France internationals in their squad – but in a so-called group of death that includes Borussia Dortmund, last season's runners-up in the Champions League, and Napoli, the runners-up in Serie A, this game may well represent Arsenal's best chance to pick up the away win that could be crucial to their hopes of reaching the knockout stage. "If you look at the group, it is the hardest because all four teams have a chance to qualify, that means every game is very important, and on average you need 10 points to qualify, so that gives you the task," Wenger said. "We have a good away record – we have always been very audacious away. Sometimes at home, through some spells last season, we played a bit with the handbrake because we have not had the same confidence at the Emirates that we have away from home. But we will always try to play."

The two titans of Concacaf meet with World Cup qualification on the line. The USA hosts Mexico at the Columbus Crew stadium. A special scarf has been unveiled for the occasion. The US finds itself in pole position to qualify, while Mexico has struggled to score goals and win games and fired their coach after an embarrassing loss to Honduras at home. Parity does not describe the rivalry, but rather the concept of "pendulum." Momentum swings back and forth, and has for almost a century. The storylines and rivalry started in the 1930s, when the two teams squared off in a playoff to qualify for the 1934 World Cup. Both teams traveled by boat over a month to a neutral venue in Italy, and took vastly difference approaches to preparation. The American team exercised on the deck of the boat, while the Mexican team relaxed and confided in its superior technical ability. They were wrong. The US won 4-2 and qualified, but the pendulum swung in Mexico's favor soon thereafter. A year later, Mexico beat the US three times for a combined goal differential of 19-6. Thus, the following pattern emerged: US upsets Mexico, then motivated Mexico goes on a run of dominance. Only in later decades would a semblance of parity emerge. Here are a few key games in that journey: 1980: Yet Another Mexi-Massacre Since defeating Mexico to qualify for the 1934 World Cup, the US went on a dry spell of historic proportions. The US only qualified for one other World Cup for a span of almost six decades, while Mexico came to dominate the US and the Concacaf region. In qualification for the 1982 World Cup, Mexico hosted the US at the dreaded Azteca stadium just outside Mexico City. The tricolor pasted the US 5-1, even though in later rounds they would fall just short of qualifying. Even if Central American nations had started to close the gap, the Americans still looked clueless on the field. Lopsided losses to Mexico were the norm. But not for long. Eight years later, misfortune befell Mexico and a door opened for the US. FIFA caught Mexico using over-aged players in the Olympics, and banned them from World Cup qualification. Paul Caliguiri's goal vs. Trinidad and Tobago booked the US's ticket to Italia 1990. More importantly, the US team now had the talent to capitalize on Mexico's missteps (at least off the field). A large talent gap remained between the two nations, but the US could at lest compete with the Central American and Caribbean nations (and Canada). 1991: The American Ascent The US qualified for Italia 1990, but had a pretty lousy tournament. College-educated players looked like clueless boys against European pros. Folks wondered: was the US for real or a one-hit wonder? The inaugural Gold Cup was the perfect stage for the US to build on recent success and lay a foundation. In the semifinals, USA squared off against the neighbor to the South. Mexico fielded a full roster and was hungry for redemption. A noticeably pro-Mexico crowd of 41,000 packed the LA coliseum and cheered on the tricolor. The first half ended goalless, but, shortly after the break, Mexico failed to clear a free kick. USA's John Doyle side footed first-time a deflected header and beat the keeper at his near post. The stadium fell silent, except for the scattered US fans. 15 minutes later, Peter Vermes, current coach of Sporting KC, latched onto a Fernando Clavijo clearance, fought off one defender, cut inside another, and lobbed the keeper to the far post from outside the box. It was a spectacular goal that crushed any hopes of a Mexican comeback. The US was still far from producing topflight players, but the Doyle and Vermes goals showed competent athletes capable of bursts of brilliance. 1993: Revenge of the Aztecs The 1993 Gold Cup Final was a harsh lesson for the US. America was hosting the World Cup the following year, so the team had been spared the rigors of qualification and the Gold Cup presented the best opportunity for competitive matches. In the final, the US faced Mexico at the Azteca stadium, a cavernous cell block on the outskirts of Mexico City where altitude sickness meets toxic air pollutants. The US conceded in the 19th minute and never got into the game. A Desmond Armstrong own goal in the 31st minute ended the game before halftime, and the final 4-0 scoreline was flattering. The US may have been able to squeeze out a semifinal Gold Cup win at home two years earlier, but many of the team's top players lacked "cancha", ie, experience playing in hostile away stadiums. It would not be their last defeat at the dreaded Azteca. Luckily, one year later, Major League Soccer would open its doors. While the league would engage in a few gimmicks (walk up penalty kicks?) and some franchises would fold (Miami, Tampa Bay), it would offer college players without the chops for Europe a viable second option. The pool of professional US players would soon expand exponentially. 2002: A Monumental World Cupset Mexico won three Gold Cups in a row, but, in World Cup 2002, faced an unfamiliar rival in the Round of 16: the United States. El Tri had dominated the Gold Cup, but, in 1996, Major League Soccer had begun. The quality of play in the league was relatively poor but still light years ahead of collegiate soccer. For six years, MLS grew and groomed players to become professionals. The US roster for Japan/Korea featured several MLS players, including Clint Mathis and Eddie Pope. If 1991 showed the US could produce good soccer, then 2002 showed that MLS could turn out good soccer players. The US beat Mexico 2-0 on goals by Brian McBride and Landon Donovan. McBride was a former player of the Columbus Crew, while Landon Donovan had lit MLS nets aflame with the San Jose Earthquakes. Granted, key players for the US, such as Claudio Reyna and John O'Brien, had never played professionally stateside. Still, MLS had indisputably expanded the professional opportunities for US players and helped the national team. American fans will never forget the cups of coffee downed to stay awake during the early morning games or Rafa Marquez's vicious elbow to the cranium of US winger Cobi Jones. Cobi is still the US all-time leader in international caps, even if Brian McBride one-upped his World Cup injury record with a bloody Daniel De Rossi elbow in 2006. 2007: A Volley Good Time For two decades, the US-Mexico rivalry fell into an established rhythm. In terms of trophies, the US would pull off a feisty upset from time-to-time in between Mexican runs of utter dominance. In terms of games, US players were superb athletes but less proficient technically. Thus, the US always camped out in its own half and hoped to score off a set piece or a counterattack. Conversely, Mexican players loved to keep the ball, even if shooting was a better option than a pass. Games were contests of cat and mouse...at least until 2007. Bob Bradley, then the US coach, tinkered with the traditional game plan and bravely pushed his back line forward in games against Mexico (and other stiff competition). Often, the gamble backfired and an opposing striker would spring the US's naive offside trap. However, when it worked, the US actually retained possessions for longer spells and constructed first-touch attacks through the middle. Against Mexico in the 2007 Gold Cup Final, the US won 2-1 and also played some pretty soccer. Benny Feilhaber's tournament-winning volley was a stroke of individual genius, but the collective effort and cohesive game plan made it possible. Many US fans ask: just what happened to Benny? Shortly after the Gold Cup, his club career took a nosedive. He failed to crack the first team at his German club Hamburger SV, embarked on a nomadic journey of Freddy Adu proportions, and ended up in the second division of a Scandinavian league. He still made the 2010 World Cup roster, but as a late game sub. Guess who tossed his career a lifeline? MLS. Benny still hasn't fought his way back into the USMNT fold, but if he has any more flashes of brilliance left, don't be surprised if he does. 2012: Over the Hump Again, Mexico went on a run of Gold Cup wins. The US lost two finals to Mexico in a row, both by wide margins. However, in 2012, new coach Jurgen Klinsmann arrived unfazed. In a friendly against Mexico at the dreaded Azteca, he fielded a youthful roster with few veterans. From his perspective, it was probably a lose-win situation. The youngsters would get blooded in a hostile environment, and few expected a draw, let alone a win. Before that game, the US had only drawn one game and lost all the others. Klinsmann fielded his normally lopsided 4-2-3-1, but the players were even more cautious than normal. Few dared to set foot in the opposing half. As the game wore on, Mexican fans grew restless and the home side grew nervous. The first half ended 0-0, and the second half looked to be a repeat. The physical and organized Americans ceded the middle of the field, but choked off space around the box. With 20 minutes left, Klinsmann tossed on three substitutes: Brek Shea, Terrance Boyd, and Michael Fiscal. In the 80th minute, they combined for a lovely game-winning goal. Thanks to a heelpass and a toepoke, the US earned their first ever win at the Azteca. The win broke a mental block for Americans, and set the stage for a World Cup draw at the Azteca several months later. This September, Mexico finds itself in an odd position: an underdog needing a win in a hostile environment. If history is any guide, expect the unexpected. Just when one of these rivals gets seated comfortably on the Concacaf throne, he gets knocked off the perch. Elliott Turner blogs about soccer at Futfanatico.com

Manchester City qualified for the Champions League group stage for the first time with a resounding 5-2 win over CSKA Moscow, with Manuel Pellegrini warning that no team in the competition would be "happy" to face his side. City sealed their passage with an Álvaro Negredo hat-trick and a Sergio Agüero double. Each of them also scored in the 7-0 win here over Norwich City on Saturday, which made 12 goals in total for the club in their past two games. Agüero became City's top finisher in Europe with the two strikes against CSKA, a penalty after three minutes and the later finish taking him to 12 goals to overtake Francis Lee's mark of 10. The Argentinian has 13 in 13 City appearances this campaign and Negredo, in his debut season for the club, has nine in 16 outings. Pellegrini was asked how the pair compare with the Liverpool partnership of Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suárez and Manchester United's Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney. "I think both of them have played really well not only today but the whole season," he said. "For Sergio he is in a great moment, because he is not only scoring but his movement and his contribution to the team is important. Álvaro too. They have got the goals they deserve. "It is important to have such quality of striker but for both of them I think it is important the way the team is playing and we are backing up their efforts brilliantly. In the past three days we have scored 12 goals and again, as a group, what we are doing is impressive. "We have a strong team, the minimum target is to qualify for the next round but it is not our only target. We have a strong squad, we will see who we will play in February, but I can assure you they will not be very happy to play against us." The City playmakers Samir Nasri and David Silva were also among the most impressive performers. "The pair are very good players who are playing very well but the way we are playing, too, gives them freedom and [that] is important for them," said the manager. "The strikers combining up front allows them to play very well and to interact in the forward line, so I think it is a mix of factors why they are playing so well at this time. It is [also] important not to forget about Yaya [Touré] and Fernandinho, because they are producing a lot of quality passing from the midfield." Pellegrini believes that City can match any team. "I think we can beat any side now, when we play at our best," he said. "But at this level the most important teams can also beat us – I think the most important teams in Italy, Spain and France are competitive. So we will see where we go now." Pellegrini wants City to top the group, which would mean them having to beat Viktoria Plzen, then Bayern Munich who recorded an emphatic 3-1 win at the Etihad last month. "Of course we are going to try and top the group," the manager said. "It is important to try and do that and we will keep trying to the end to get above Bayern." After Touré was racially abused in the reverse fixture a fortnight ago there appeared no repeat of any incidents. Three of the Russian club's fans were arrested, though this was reportedly for fighting among themselves. Touré said: "We must say thank you to the [City] fans today, they showed the fans of CSKA how to support a team. Today is a special day. The target is to go as far as possible. It's amazing, it's history for the club."

A club with Manchester City's ambitions will always want more but, after everything that has gone before, they will cherish what it is like to qualify for the knockout stages with something to spare. It is a new feeling in these parts, having endured more disappointments in the Champions League than they will probably care to remember, but finally they have made it. At the very least that is a clear sign of improvement. True, there were times when Manuel Pellegrini's team lapsed into carelessness but not, as we have seen before, originating from the kind of anxiety that has held them back in this tournament over the last couple of seasons. The mistakes had their origins in complacency, stemming from their own superiority. This is always a risk when there is such an imbalance of talent and the home side have blitzed their opponents with three goals inside the opening half an hour. Another two arrived in the second half, as Álvaro Negredo rounded off his hat-trick, meaning City have now accumulated 12 goals in four days. Sergio Agüero managed the first two against CSKA, on a night when both of City's forwards demonstrated their penalty-box expertise, and it was only a passing irritation that Seydou Doumbia, the Russian side's Ivory Coast international striker, scored a couple of his own. On both occasions the visitors were three goals behind, bamboozled by the speed and incisiveness of City's attacking. As Pellegrini pointed out afterwards, there were another half a dozen opportunities to add more goals. Group D has brought its occasional traumas and nobody should get too carried away bearing in mind the memories are still vivid of Bayern Munich dismantling City on this ground a month ago. Yet CSKA and Viktoria Plzen have been obliging opponents and Pellegrini's cosmopolitan team, again featuring no Englishmen in the starting XI, won this match with a mix of panache and impatience. Agüero, in devastating form over the past month, was instrumental in it and has now gone above Franny Lee as City's leading scorer in European competition, with 12 goals. Even ignoring the expertise with which he took his goals, the nutmeg on CSKA's right-back, Kirill Nababkin, late in the first half was a joy. His pass for Negredo's first goal, picking out the Spaniard at the far post, was not too shabby either. Agüero has made a habit of creating goals for his team-mates recently, a provider and finisher playing at the point of maximum expression. Negredo has quickly established himself as a crowd favourite, serenaded with chants of "feed the Beast and he will score" in a modern variation of the old Shaun Goater song. Samir Nasri is playing with the kind of confidence that was seen too infrequently last season. David Silva, such a clever and elusive opponent, was prominently involved from the start, coaxing the challenge from Zoran Tosic that led to Agüero opening the scoring from the penalty spot. Fernandinho was culpable for a mistake in the build-up to Doumbia's first goal but City, for the most part, had control of midfield. Costel Pantilimon also had a reasonable night overall, after a slightly erratic first half that saw him make a total hash of one attempted punch. Agüero's penalty was elegantly taken, high into the top left-hand corner of Igor Akinfeev's goal, but it was his second goal that really epitomised his confidence, latching on to Nasri's pass then turning the nearest opponent, Aleksei Berezutski, and picking his spot with a side-footed finish. When he crossed for Negredo to make it 3-0 it was tempting to wonder whether CSKA might suffer the kind of ordeal that was inflicted upon Norwich at the weekend. Instead Fernandinho missed a challenge in midfield and suddenly Doumbia was running clear, going round Pantilimon before turning the ball into the net. That might have enveloped the stadium in anxiety during some of their European ties in the Roberto Mancini era. Instead City quickly reasserted their authority. Five minutes into the second half Yaya Touré dinked a little chip into the penalty area. CSKA's defence did not react, hoping for an offside flag, and Nasri waited for the ball to drop then flicked it into Negredo's path for another close-range finish. For a while the pace dropped, with any faint prospect of a CSKA comeback now extinguished. Fernandinho had gone off at half-time, replaced by James Milner, which at least meant Roy Hodgson's scouts did not have an entirely wasted trip. Silva and Nasri were also removed in the second half and, though City continued to hog possession, their passing was no longer so sharp and penetrative. All the same Doumbia's second goal, like the first, came out of nothing, the forward wriggling past Gaël Clichy and then bundled over by the Frenchman for a penalty that he took himself. Shortly before, Negredo had almost completed his hat-trick in spectacular fashion, volleying over after a lovely, improvised turn had taken out two defenders. Instead his third goal was far more orthodox as he headed in Milner's cross at the far post. He and Agüero now have 22 goals between them this season and City, at last, can look forward to remaining a part of this competition beyond the turn of the year.

This was not how Arsène Wenger had intended to celebrate his 64th birthday. Borussia Dortmund had been advertised as the acid test of Arsenal's recent prowess: the first team they have faced this season who are steeped in top-level know-how. For much of a tight but quirkily gripping encounter Wenger's players held their own against one of the continent's elite, even though they failed to find their offensive groove. And there was encouragement to be found in the way they recovered from a shaky start to stretch the visitors. Olivier Giroud was their star turn, gilding a muscular performance with the equaliser, and Arsenal almost nicked it when the substitute Santi Cazorla rattled the woodwork in the 69th minute from Mesut Özil's pass. It was one of those evenings when the margins were slim to non-existent. But Dortmund did not reach last season's Champions League final by accident. There is a non-stop energy about their game, along with a cold-eyed ruthlessness that is epitomised by the striker Robert Lewandowski. They staged what could be described as the classic smash-and-grab to floor Arsenal and, rather abruptly, imperil their Champions League progress. It was a vicious counter-punch at the bitter end and Wenger will rue the manner in which his team left themselves exposed when a draw was looking like a decent result. Lewandowski did not stop to ask questions. From the moment he moved on to Kevin Grosskreutz's cross, in yards of space, there was no doubt what would happen next. He guided his volley past Wojciech Szczesny without his heart skipping a beat. Lewandowski had been at the centre of controversy in the 64th minute when he flung out his elbow in an aerial challenge to clatter Laurent Koscielny. He was booked and, for a second, it looked as though the card from the Swedish referee, Jonas Eriksson, might have been red. Lewandowski kept swinging until the last and, for the first time in 13 matches, Arsenal have tasted defeat. Their group, arguably the toughest in the competition, has come to feature three teams on six points, with Arsenal having played two home ties. It is likely they will need a result in either Dortmund or Naples. Arsenal have 19 points at the top of the Premier League after eight matches but the pessimists among their support point out that they took all 24 from the corresponding fixtures last season. They are now into a testing two weeks or so, which include league games against Liverpool and Manchester United, plus the return in Dortmund. They must bounce back at Crystal Palace on Saturday. Arsenal handed Dortmund the initiative at the outset and the goal was a calamity for Aaron Ramsey, perhaps the first black mark on his season. After Marco Reus had given the ball away to Mikel Arteta on a Dortmund thrust, Ramsey took over. But he dwelt on the ball and was robbed by Reus. The winger found Lewandowski, who shifted the ball to Henrikh Mkhitaryan, and his swerving, low shot deceived Szczesny. What Mkhitaryan lacks in vowels, he makes up for in quicksilver threat. Jürgen Klopp, serving his touchline ban, was out of his seat in the stands while the travelling Dortmund fans, a bouncing, yellow, relentless mass, savoured the moment. One feature of the evening was the TV director's love of the quick cut between Klopp, in funky black tie, and Wenger. Arsenal responded in style and it was Giroud who led the charge. The No9 was in swashbuckling mood, barging over opponents and rampaging in behind the Dortmund defence. He was crudely checked by Mats Hummels on the fringes of the area – the centre-half was booked – while, from the other flank, his cross was half-cleared by Marcel Schmelzer and Tomas Rosicky was able to shoot. Roman Weidenfeller was beaten but the covering Hummels cleared from the line. There was a scare for Arsenal when Jack Wilshere needed lengthy treatment on his right foot after a heavy landing but there was delight when Giroud scored the equaliser, his seventh goal of the season. Once again there was a defensive aberration when Neven Subotic lunged at Bacary Sagna's right-wing cross, only to succeed in distracting Weidenfeller, who fumbled the ball. Giroud profited from point-blank range. Wenger and Klopp had matched each other with their formations and it became a battle of wits in midfield. Dortmund were slick in patches but Arsenal need not beat themselves up about their game. They looked the likelier winners in the second half, particularly after Cazorla replaced Wilshere, whose evening was more of a battle against his thresholds of pain. He felt a few heavy challenges and he seemed to be attempting to run off knocks for long periods. A big bag of ice was pressed to his foot when he took his seat on the bench. Chances were scarce, yet it was tense and riveting. One mistake or moment of quality would be decisive. Arsenal fashioned the latter when Özil, who roamed but generally struggled to impose himself, exchanged passes with Ramsey to cut-back for Cazorla. The Spaniard's first-time rising drive hit the angle of post and crossbar. Cazorla also saw another effort blocked. If Arsenal were not to win, then they had to insulate themselves against defeat. However, Lewandowski brought them to their knees. The extent of the pain will become clearer in the coming weeks.

Tony Pulis may or may not keep Crystal Palace in the Premier League but after a bullish and unexpectedly allusive public unveiling at the club's training ground one thing seems certain. Palace's new manager is unlikely to go without a fight. Looking rugged, lean and tanned alongside his – in the best Palace boardroom tradition – smooth, coiffed and perma-tanned co-chairman Steve Parish, Pulis refused to elaborate on tactics, January transfer targets or the rumours of a substantial anti-relegation incentive in his contract. He did mention the charge of the Light Brigade, Genghis Khan, Winston Churchill and his own enduring love of Napoleon, while communicating also that familiar sense of single-minded purpose. Pulis left Stoke in May after five Premier League years garnished with a cup final and a mini-run in the Europa League, succumbing eventually to a sense of declining momentum and of gathering lassitude among the club's support. There is undoubtedly a mutual expediency to his appointment on a contract rumoured to be worth up to £1m a year. Palace need a dramatic and improbable shift of fortunes. Pulis needs a club who need Tony Pulis. "I went to the Crimea and spent a week looking at different things. I saw the field where the charge of the Light Brigade took place. I saw the palace where Churchill and Roosevelt divided the world up after the war," Pulis said of his recent spell out of football. He will no doubt get the desired militaristic headlines but beyond the Balaclava analogies – the British may have charged straight and long but they were also cut to pieces – this was still a rather opaque opening statement of intent by a manager whose methods have already attracted a degree of scepticism from Palace fans after a month in which the club has been linked with an ever-revolving cast of improbables (from Dan Petrescu to Iain Dowie). Pulis may have a distinguished Premier League pedigree at a club of similar stature, albeit with more in the way of disposable income, but attention will naturally focus on his preferred style of play, an unapologetic version of aerial muscle ball. In the white heat of the Terry Venables era Palace were once dubbed "the team of the 80s". Under Pulis, enduring zealot of direct football, they might get the chance to live up to that billing. Not that he has ever accepted this is the way he sets his teams out to play. "I personally don't think we were [a long-ball team] at Stoke. When you have Matthew Etherington, Charlie Adam, Steven Nzonzi you've got some really top players and we weren't that. The problem is you start in a way that will make you successful and you build up from there and you get a reputation for playing a certain way, but you try to take it on. For the seven years I was there we had that upward curve. "It's down to the players you've got. You put an identity on a team, you put an identify on a football club. "I hate going to watch games of football and at the end you don't know what that team is trying to achieve. So having an identity is key for me. Whether it's Swansea or whoever. It's determined by the players." Methods aside, Pulis can point to the fact he has never been relegated (sacked, but never relegated) during a 21-year career as a manager during which a key strength has been his ability to reverse failing fortunes. For those supporters concerned about whether Palace have the right man to manage the development of a thriving club academy there were some reassuring words, albeit laden with caveats. "The academy was one of the reasons I came here. They've always produced fine young players," Pulis said, referencing his past successes with Ryan Shawcross, Asimir Begovic and Nzonzi at Stoke (none of whom actually came through at Stoke) as evidence of his credentials. "Sometimes it gets lost in the wash. Everybody wants to have a young vibrant team, everybody wants young players but they have to be good enough." It is a dilemma that seems to speak to Palace's position. Supporters may want a manager for the next five years, and a move away from the club's own grand Premier League tradition of mid-season panic hires, but for the board the next six months are everything. It is a familiar wrangle at a time when simply existing in the Premier League carries such vertiginously disproportionate financial rewards. Pulis may not be everybody's Mr Right but he is Mr Right Now. Palace's new manager will take training for the first timeon Tuesday, the first step in a lucrative two-and-half-year contract that is rumoured to have its fair share of exit clauses, before kicking off the Crystal Pulis regime at Norwich on Saturday.

A French restaurateur has launched a new burger called "Le Zlatan" in a homage to the Paris St-Germain striker and has challenged the Swede to visit the restaurant and finish the monster burger. Jean-Philippe Grandin, the manager of Doddy's Cafe in the Parisian suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt, said he wanted to create "an exceptional burger, which really stands out from the crowd, in the image of Zlatan Ibrahimovic". The burger, just like the PSG forward, is a commanding presence, combining 600 grams of mince beef with onions, bacon and three types of cheese including cheddar, Emmental and Auvergne blue, all contained in a giant bun that has been specially made for the restaurant. While the Benfica manager, Jorge Jesus, may consider doubling up defensively to counter the threat posed by Ibrahimovic in Wednesday's Champions League tie, Grandin suggested a similar medicine for anyone willing to tackle "Le Zlatan", with the menu proudly boasting that "even Chuck Norris couldn't fit it in his mouth". The burger commands a hefty price tag setting customers back almost €30. While the real-life Zlatan hasn't yet tackled himself in burger form, Grandin hopes that a meeting isn't far off, adding he would like to see his hero finish the entire creation. The inclusion of the strong Auvergne blue cheese is especially significant. "It's a cheese with taste and character, just like Ibrahimovic," Grandin told Le Parisien. "Only seven people have managed to finish it so far." "I managed to eat more than half of it," his assistant, Kelly, 29, said. "I'd recommend this burger to everyone. It truly has the strength and power of Zlatan Ibrahimovic."

Roy Hodgson has issued his most rousing rallying cry since taking over as manager of the national team by insisting his England players "will deliver" qualification for the World Cup in Brazil over the next five days. England know victories in their final two group games, against Montenegro on Friday and Poland next Tuesday, will secure Group H and automatic passage to next summer's tournament after a qualifying campaign that has rather stuttered towards its conclusion. Hodgson conceded his side have yet to produce an eye-catching result in the section, having failed to beat any side other than Moldova and San Marino, but he retains an unswerving faith in a near full-strength squad in the build-up to the two fixtures which may yet serve to define his tenure. "Bring the game on," said Hodgson. "Really, this game can't come quickly enough. We're ready for it. We believe in ourselves, we trust in each other. We have the right determination, the right motivation. We're looking at one game. We'll get out and win that. And when we've won that, we'll look at the next one. And we'll be equally determined to win that one, too. It's Wembley, we are England, we have good players, and I believe the players will deliver. "We haven't had a marquee result. The one we did have was the friendly against Brazil at home [which was won 2-1 in February], or maybe the draw away [in June], but you can't have a marquee result in a friendly. But if I compare how I feel about the team today compared to 18 months ago, just before the Euros, I think we're a long way forward on that. There are so many exciting younger talents now who will stand us in good stead further on. These two games would be a perfect opportunity to prove that and maybe improve the mood somewhat. "People do doubt sometimes, and can quote the statistics: you haven't beaten the Ukraine, you only drew in Poland … This will give us an opportunity to put that right. I know the players are ready to do that. They're determined to do that. We all realise that England expects. They expect us to play well in these two games, win them, and get to the World Cup. We are England, we are one of the big nations and we're expected to qualify for World Cups and European Championships. The players will not shirk their responsibility. None of us will." Hodgson spoke of striking a "balance" in his selection for a game in which England will anticipate hogging possession against the former group leaders. Both the manager and his captain, Steven Gerrard, betrayed genuine excitement at the prospect of Wayne Rooney linking with Daniel Sturridge in attack, with the pair having impressed together all week in training. James Milner is expected to play on the right, with Hodgson considering pairing Gerrard with Frank Lampard in an experienced central midfield – with Michael Carrick an alternative option – leaving Jack Wilshere most likely among the substitutes. The Arsenal player has been playing on the left in recent weeks for the Premier League leaders, with Hodgson having admitted he may have to "break some hearts" when he informs those players who will not start at a team meeting morning. Regardless, having lost only Ashley Cole through injury since naming his squad last week, he is convinced the team he sends out against a country ranked 27 in the world – albeit one England have never beaten in a competitive fixture – but who arrive at a sold out Wembley severely depleted by injuries to key personnel, will have enough to prevail. "It's been one of the hardest selection weeks I've had, with so many senior players available and the younger ones knocking on the door for a starting place, but I believe in the players, I trust the players," he added. "You can use statistics how you want to use them. We've played some big games outside this qualifying group: we've played Italy away, Sweden away, Norway away, Belgium at home, Brazil twice, and home nations in difficult matches. I've seen the players step up to the plate and do well. This time we're even stronger on paper than we've been for a while. I know how determined the players are to do the job, making certain we step out and perform, we deliver. I have every reason to trust and believe them. In the time I've worked with them, they've never given me reason to doubt. Within the camp, we are convinced we are a good team. "It's a big responsibility, taking on the role as manager of an England team. But this has been a great week so far. The training sessions lift me. The quality of the training sessions gives me an enormous lift. Quite frankly, I take a normal approach: two great games, two good games to play. I do believe in the team, believe in ourselves and everything we're doing, I have every confidence in them. I think it can be a very good few days ahead, and that's what I'm anticipating."

There was hatred between the two clubs even before Mario Götze left Borussia Dortmund for Bayern Munich. Now, though, it seems to have reached a completely different level. On Saturday Götze returns to the club that gave him his footballing education from the age of nine to 21 for the first time since his transfer to their bitter rivals from the south. He will, as one German newspaper put it, "have to go through 90 minutes of yellow-and-black hell". The atmosphere is likely to be so hostile that Jens Lehmann, a former Dortmund player, has advised the 21-year-old Götze to avoid taking any corners or throw-ins. "He should probably look to stay mainly in the centre circle," said the former goalkeeper. The Dortmund fans have already had chances to display their utter disgust at Götze – and did it with venom. The player's transfer to Bayern was leaked – and confirmed – in April and the following month at a game at the Westfalenstadion a huge banner was unfurled, saying "The pursuit of money shows how much heart one has. Fuck you Götze." And if that was the feeling of animosity while he was still at the club one fears what he may encounter him when he appears in red on Saturday. There have been suggestions in the German media that pig heads may fly Götze's way in scenes similar to those that greeted Luis Figo after his transfer from Barcelona to Real Madrid in 2002. Sol Campbell's move from Tottenham to Arsenal and Mo Johnston joining Rangers having played for Celtic are other transfers that have been mentioned on the same scale as Götze's. One Dortmund fan, Eugen Kraas, said this week: "I take it for granted that Götze will be mercilessly whistled. The fact that he went to Bayern of all clubs! It was a brutal deal. When he was playing for Dortmund he was strong as a bear, he stood out, but now he is just one of many players at Bayern." The Götze backdrop is far from the only reason for Dortmund fans to feel aggrieved. This week the Germany coach, Joachim Löw, sent home two Bayern players, Philipp Lahm and Manuel Neuer, to get some rest before the friendly against England but kept all five Dortmund players in the squad. There had already been talk of conspiracy theories before the game but it got a lot worse after Tuesday as two Dortmund defenders were injured at Wembley, Mats Hummels and Marcel Schmelzer. Add the fact that Dortmund were already without Neven Subotic for the season with knee ligament damage, that Lukasz Piszczek is just returning from injury and that the influential midfielder Ilkay Gündogan is also out, it is clear that the balance has tipped Bayern's way even before the kick-off. And this is not a concern only for Dortmund but for the whole of the league. The Dortmund v Bayern games have become Klassikers in the Bundesliga but there is a danger here that Bayern are becoming too strong for their nearest rivals as well. Pep Guardiola has not lost a game and Bayern's unbeaten run extends to November 2012. Bayern, who are missing Franck Ribéry because of a rib injury, are four points ahead of Dortmund and Sami Hyypia's Bayer Leverkusen, and a win at the Westfalenstadion would severely dent the excitement of the whole season. It is not quite has bad as Sebastian Vettel having pretty much wrapped up the Formula One championship in September but not far from it. Dortmund are not a club to give up and the general manager, Michael Zorc, told Kicker this week: "We don't raise the white flag for anyone. We have said and we continue to say that we can still beat Bayern Munich. We are looking forward to the game even though the conditions have changed and, for us, have got considerably worse. We will have to improvise and we will be able to. What happened at Wembley happens in football and we are not making an issue of it." The chief executive, Hans-Joachim Watzke, is trying to play down expectations in light of the injuries and said: "Anyone who thinks we have a 50-50 chance against Bayern is suffering from a severe lack of reality." He then went a step further and more or less wrote off Dortmund's chances of winning the title. The fans have not given up though and if there was ever a match that would get the best out of the Yellow Wall it is surely this back-against-the-walls occasion. Even before the Götze deal and the Germany injuries there were years of animosity. Perhaps the most violent of clashes between Dortmund and Bayern came in April 2001 with the two clubs still involved in the title. The game spiralled completely out of control almost immediately and ended with the referee, Hartmut Strampe, brandishing 12 yellow cards and three reds. Only two of Bayern's starting XI were not shown a card of some sort with Bixente Lizarazu and Stefan Effenberg being sent off. Afterwards a war of words broke out between Matthias Sammer and Bayern's Uli Hoeness, with the latter saying said that the Dortmund player Otto Addo should work in a circus because of his theatrical falls. There are unlikely to be 15 cards shown on Saturday but one thing is for sure: Götze will be the centre of attention. "I have no fear, that's for sure," the Bayern player said this week, before admitting that it will be "the hardest moment" of his career. The Dortmund fans, the ones who used to adore him and the ones who used to buy the shirts with his name on the back, will make doubly sure of that.

It is arguably the greatest goal ever scored in women's club football in the US and it was an Australian boot that struck it into the back of the net. On a Saturday evening in June at Yurack Field in New Jersey, Perth-born Lisa De Vanna helped start Sky Blue FC's attacking move through the Boston Breakers' defence as she combined with Katy Freels before finishing it with an exquisite bicycle kick. "It happened so quick," says Boston midfielder and fellow Australian Kyah Simon of her compatriot's stunning overhead strike. "I was watching from the halfway line. As [Freels] scooped it up I thought the last time I saw someone scoop the ball was when I played indoor soccer ten years ago. So I had no idea what was going on at that point. "And then Lisa just came out of nowhere with a bicycle kick and I had never seen her do one before in training or games. Caitlin [Foord, another Australian, who plays for De Vanna's Sky Blue team] and I just turned to ourselves and were like, 'Did she really just do that?'" That flash of inspiration was the most captivating moment amongst a string of standout performances this season from the five Australians in the new professional National Women's Soccer League - Emily van Egmond at Seattle Reign and Samantha Kerr at Western New York Flash, along with De Vanna, Foord and Simon. More importantly, their American experience could help write the history of this generation of Matildas, who are looking to take the next step on the international scene. While the days of players paying their own way to training camps and international tournaments may be long gone, the problem for the Australian women's football team since its establishment in the 1970s has always been playing time. After the 2011 Olympic women's football qualifying tournament it was over nine months before the Matildas gathered again for an international match. When the team gathered in Canberra for a double-header against New Zealand in June of this year it had been almost as long between games. The brief 12-week W-League season, the domestic women's competition, doesn't yet offer a solution to this problem. So with the chance to defend their Asian Cup title in 2014 fast approaching, the hopes of the Matildas have received an unexpected boost from North America. Last year out of the ashes of the self-imploded Women's Professional Soccer league in the US came the NWSL. It is an initiative set up with funding from the American, Canadian and Mexican football federations to give their players the same crucial competitive playing time Matildas coach Hesterine De Reus wants for her charges. The league's first regular season finished last weekend and the consensus is that the five Matildas thrived in a league where, as Foord puts it, they "run and run and run". "The Aussies have definitely put a stamp on the league and I'm hoping more and more girls flock over here to the US and soak up the experience," says Simon. "The main aspect is probably the physical aspect of the game. It definitely contributes with my fitness and my sharpness as well. I come from more of a European style football back in Australia. So when you compliment that with a higher fitness level and a higher agility it falls hand in hand. "If we instilled that a little bit into our game as we are building through this transition phase we can really take some positives from experiencing the US league." While De Vanna is a storied international with two World Cups under her belt, the average age of the other four Aussies in the NWSL is under 20 years old. The even distribution of US internationals across the league means each of them are now playing alongside some of their generation's most successful athletes such as Hope Solo, Abby Wambach and Christie Rampone. When Foord's season ended due to a strained ankle with her side on the verge of entering the play-offs, it was the advice of the 38-year-old veteran Rampone that helped the Wollongong native find some perspective. "You're young, you're going to heal so quick," Rampone told her. "You're going to have so many more opportunities." That advice coming from a mother of two who's experienced the lows of major injuries through to the highs of World Cup glory struck a chord with the 18-year-old Foord. "For Christie, for the age she's at and after having two kids, she's an amazing person," she explained. "How she's still playing so well and so fit, just learning from her, she's told our team a few things about how you get an injury and you just keep going. From doing that look at what she's achieved." With two of the four teams in the NWSL play-offs featuring some of the Australians – Western New York and Sky Blue – attention for these five Matildas will soon turn back to international football. "When I first came into the national team we came off that really good performance at the 2007 World Cup," says Simon. "I think that was the time when women's football kind of got evaluated and it was like we actually are world contenders, we can compete. We're no longer going into games and trying not to lose and trying not to get goals scored against us. We're going into games knowing we have the ability." Ability that will now be backed by a touch of American steel.

Blackburn Rovers lost their star striker Jordan Rhodes to Middlesbrough, but that was the height of any upset suffered by the Lancashire club on a day when Oxford failed to repeat the heroics that earned them so many plaudits in the wake of their FA Cup third-round victory over Swansea City. A physical, energetic Rovers side ran out comfortable winners at the Kassam Stadium having never allowed their hosts to settle. It was an outcome that came as a surprise for many who considered the League Two side favourites despite the two divisions separating the sides. “I suppose it’s quite flattering to go into a game where some people might have seen us as favourites,” said their manager Michael Appleton. “But it’s ridiculous as well because of the number of league places between the two teams.” They may have been purveyors of the most notable third-round shock in their defeat of Swansea but Oxford’s latest Cup adventure will not live long in the memory. There was no shame in this exit, but Appleton’s side failed to do themselves justice in a match that was over as a contest by the interval. “In the first 25 minutes we played like a five-a-side team,” he said. “We didn’t earn the right to play and we were just a little bit naive.” With his team mired in a wretched run of league form, this could have been an excruciating afternoon for the Rovers manager, Paul Lambert. The Scot made six changes, one of them forced by the departure from the team hotel of Rhodes to complete a medical at Boro and finalise a deal reported to be worth £13m. Signed from Charlton Athletic on Friday, his replacement Tony Watt was quick to step into the big metaphorical boots of his predecessor. Things started fairly badly for Oxford and went quickly downhill. Johnny Mullins was fortunate to remain on the field after bringing down Simeon Jackson after just five minutes, but despite being swarmed by Rovers players demanding a red card, the referee, Andy Davies, deemed yellow sufficient. From the ensuing free-kick, Ben Marshall struck wide. In the thick of the action, Jackson was later tripped by Joe Skarz as he advanced into the penalty area in pursuit of a through-ball from Watt. Davies pointed to the spot and Ben Marshall promptly slotted into the corner. It was the first of two goals in a half dominated by Blackburn and the second came just before the interval when Watt fired home from 25 yards. His low, long-range drive inched past the outstretched fingers of Sam Slocombe from outside the penalty area. Watt’s goal was the highlight of a game in which Blackburn’s defence was superb and allowed Kemar Roofe none of the freedom afforded to him by Swansea, and he cut an isolated figure as this match progressed. Oxford offered little going forward but could have gone ahead when Liam Sercombe’s well-struck diagonal effort forced a fine save from Jason Steele in the Blackburn goal. Blackburn’s domination continued throughout and they should have extended their two-goal lead when, bearing down on goal from the right flank, Elliott Bennett unselfishly – and in hindsight perhaps foolishly – elected to square the ball for Watt when going for glory looked easier. It was left to Marshall to put the game beyond Oxford and prompt a 76th minute mini-exodus from those anxious to beat the traffic with a beautifully struck free-kick that arced into the bottom left-hand corner. For all their huffing and puffing, Oxford were unable to trouble a Blackburn defence that has not been renowned in recent weeks for the resolute stoutness on show here.

1) Was Arsenal's glass half-full or half-empty? Arsenal have emerged from the Group of Death to reach the Champions League knock-out phase for the 14th season in succession, after the 2-0 defeat at Napoli. Visiting teams do not merely turn up to the Stadio San Paolo and walk off with the result. There was never the danger that Arsenal would not qualify. There might have been a wobble after Gonzalo Higuaín's opening goal and Mikel Arteta's 77th-minute red card but Arsenal kept their cool. On the other hand, this was an opportunity missed. A draw or better and Arsenal's odds of a favourable last 16 draw would have rocketed but, as it is, they will face Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Atlético Madrid or Paris St-Germain. It was possible to script the narrative of Arsenal exhibiting time-honoured failings, chiefly the one about coming up short when the prize is in sight. They were passive in the second-half. They looked tired. After the 1-1 home draw against Everton on Sunday, this was another bad result and, next up for them, is Manchester City away on Saturday lunchtime. It is all going wrong … David Hytner • Match report: Napoli 2-0 Arsenal • Wenger admits to 'regret' after Napoli defeat • Pictures: all the best images from Naples 2) Drogba might remind Mourinho what he lacks José Mourinho had welcomed the possibility of the man he calls "King Didier" returning to Stamford Bridge should the draw for the knockout phase pair Chelsea with Galatasaray. In truth, the last thing this team needs now is a reminder of Drogba's prowess leading the line. Even at 35, the Ivorian remains a threat – there was a run of five goals in six games earlier this season – and his brutish presence had given the Portuguese "a headache", apparently, when his Real Madrid side were briefly bullied by the Turkish team. He is a leader of men, an inspiration, and, given the deficiencies displayed too often this term by Demba Ba, Fernando Torres and Samuel Eto'o, might show up a few of the current incumbents. His homecoming would undoubtedly be emotional. It might also remind Chelsea precisely what it is they lack in front of their cluster of creative attacking talents. Dominic Fifield • Match report: Chelsea 1-0 Steaua Bucharest • Pictures: the best images from Stamford Bridge • Chelsea weigh up £13m bid for defender Zouma 3) Manuel maths meltdown masks Munich masterclass To his credit, Pep Guardiola did call it. In the build-up to Tuesday night at the Allianz Arena, Guardiola told the German tabloid Bild that if his players played like they'd been training after a noticeably self-congratulatory Christmas party then they would lose to Manchester City. And so they did, at least for the final dozy, oddly flat 78 minutes of a performance that began at a sprint and sagged horribly in the middle. Damn you, Pep. Even in defeat, you somehow get to win. And yet Guardiola was blessed also by Manuel Pellegrini's maths-related show-stealer at the end, an act of endearingly dad-like numerical incompetence, but also a piece of misdirection that – unfortunately for Pellegrini – disguised the real story of the night, which was not the undoing of Manuel but the outwitting of Pep. Modern day super-manager he may be, a monkish, Confucian aesthete of elite European football, but Guardiola was outmanoeuvred on Tuesday night, just as his Bayern Munich team was exposed a little. Bayern may have been a little short on motivation, but they were also stretched by the direct impact running of Jesús Navas on the right and stifled, in the end, by City's tightly-knit five-man midfield, with Javi García a surprisingly dominant figure in the middle period of the match. Afterwards Pellegrini pointed out that he hadn't changed anything when City went 2-0 down, trusting instead that his plan would assert itself, that City's patterns would begin to emerge. This was against Bayern's strongest available team too, giddily kitted out with attacking midfielders, but short on explosive impact without the injured Arjen Robben and also lacking a little drive in the absence of Bastian Schweinsteiger. Barcelona have at times in their run of 10 straight Champions League victories looked pretty much unbeatable, not least at the Etihad Stadium in October. Pellegrini's gift to the knockout phase is to disturb that aura. Bayern will no doubt be back as strong as ever when it really counts. But City and Pellegrini will take huge confidence from this both at home and in Europe next year. Barney Ronay • Match report: Bayern Munich 2-3 Manchester City • Milner's mastery makes mockery of mediocre image 4) Relief for Manchester United After topping Group A, Manchester United can put their Champions League pretensions aside until the competition resumes in February. The challenge for David Moyes now is to mastermind a string of victories so that his team emerge from the congested festive period flying. Aston Villa, Stoke City, West Ham United, Hull City and Norwich City are next up before Tottenham Hotspur motor into Old Trafford on New Year's Day. In those five games Moyes and the champions have a fine chance to take all 15 points and send a clear statement that they have finally found the fight that has thus far been lacking. The unpalatable corollary, though, is continue to lose games in the Premier League and the Scot will find his future at the club in quicksand.

Ajax, Porto, Benfica and Juventus – former winners too – were all dumped into the Europa League. The criticism of the Champions League is that it is always the same old teams, the European aristocracy, that win it – but this year the likes of Zenit, Galatasaray, Olympiakos, Schalke and Leverkusen are all through. Despite their riches, even the likes of Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain are rare names to see in the knockout stages. Tom Bryant 6) Relentless Ronaldo Until Tuesday night, five people shared the record of most goals scored in the group games. Four are, to varying degrees, forwards of rare European pedigree: Hernán Crespo, Filippo Inzaghi, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. But it was the fifth, Cristiano Ronaldo, who set himself apart against Copenhagen by scoring his ninth of Real Madrid's Champions League campaign, a new record. He did so despite missing a penalty – an attempted chip that was read by the goalkeeper – and sitting out the match against Galatasaray with an injury. His strike against Copenhagen also ensured Real Madrid finished with 20 group stage goals, equalling Manchester United's 1998-99 record and Barcelona's in 2011-12. Ibrahimovic – who has eight in this campaign – might well be miffed that he was rested for the match against Benfica, thus depriving him of the chance to match Ronaldo. TB • Match report: Copenhagen 0-2 Real Madrid 7) Caley Thistle and Motherwell can only prep Celtic so much It's only 12 months since Celtic made it through a tricky group containing Barcelona and a Benfica side that would eventually reach the final of the Europa League. And with some style, to boot. Now they depart Europe in ignominy, on the end of a 6-1 thrashing at Camp Nou, their biggest humiliation in Europe since Artmedia Bratislava skelped them in the qualifiers back in 2005. Lack of serious investment is the root cause: Peter Lawwell needs to open the Celtic coffers, which are beginning to resemble the old biscuit tin again. But perhaps a lack of serious competition back home is beginning to hinder them too, with a lack of snap in the tackle evident in their rout: Cristian Tello's goal came at the end of a 40-pass move, the sort of thing that simply shouldn't be allowed to unfold, no matter how distinguished the opposition. Celtic might not want to admit it, but the sooner Rangers return from their sabbatical of shame, and sharpen them up a bit, the better. Scott Murray • Match report: Barcelona 6-1 Celtic 8) Onwards … How will all this Champions League action affect the Premier League? It's certainly been good news for Manchester United and Chelsea, who by finishing first in their groups are guaranteed to avoid the big boys until at least the start of April, and can now concentrate on domestic affairs without too much extraneous strife from overseas. Manchester City and Arsenal have no such luck; as second-placed finishers, they might be thrown into summit meetings with the likes of Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Real Madrid or Borussia Dortmund a month and a half earlier. Extra pressure may be felt at Arsenal, who are defending the leadership of the league, and were hopeful of topping their Champions League group. But no. This weekend they face City, who have just beaten the European champions and had already prepared themselves mentally as likely runners-up. A defeat at the Etihad on the back of a home draw with Everton followed by Champions League disappointment, and suddenly Arsenal might feel a little jittery. Especially with tough games against Chelsea and Newcastle coming up. The Premier League, like it's European counterpart, is on! SM 9) Three reds, three penalties and a marvellous rant After watching his side concede three penalties, two of which were saved, and then having three of his players sent off against Olympiakos, the Anderlecht coach, John van den Brom, would have been forgiven for allowing the steam to come parping out of his ears. And he didn't disappoint. "Red cards, penalties … it was like someone did not want us to leave here with a win," he said. "We continued to battle with 10, nine and eight players, but it seemed that it was certain we would not be allowed to leave with victory. I am not implying anything, I am saying what I saw." Asked if he blamed the referee, he warmed to his theme: "Were all the decisions of this man wrong? Yes. I also hear that it was the last Champions League match of the referee. Well, then I'm happy for the other teams in the Champions League. This was just outrageous." Olympiakos scraped into the last 16 courtesy of goal difference – a real achievement, given they were in a group including both the moneyed Paris Saint-Germain and Benfica, the current Europa League runners-up and the 2011/12 Champions League quarter finalists. However, despite the achievement, there will be plenty of sides hoping to face the Greeks in the next round. TB • Match report: Olympiakos 3-1 Anderlecht 10) Points do not always win prizes Napoli will look at the table, and at the 12 points they have accumulated and feel desperately hard done by. Not since Paris Saint-Germain failed to qualify for the knockout stages in 1997-98, also with a tally of 12, has a team racked up so many points yet failed to go through. They will be doubly irritated when they look over at Group G, where Zenit St Petersburg have sailed through to the last 16 with just six points. The last team to go through with fewer were Milan in 1994-95 who went through with five after having two points deducted after crowd trouble, and under the old two points for a win rule. Zenit can probably, therefore, claim to be the worst team to ever qualify from the Champions League group stages. TB

1) Newcastle's ambitions rising? After Alan Pardew oversaw Newcastle United's fine 1-0 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford, he was asked if Champions League qualification was realistic. "I'm not saying, 'No'. I just think it is the situation where if all the top teams are beating each other, it gives us an opportunity," he said. "That is encouraging. To have Everton, Southampton and ourselves West Brom and Swansea, all playing strong, as are Villa, the top teams can come unstuck and it can open the door. "All we've got to do is make sure we keep playing, get to April, and hopefully we are in the mix." Newcastle stand seventh on 26 points, four above United and three behind Manchester City, who occupy the fourth European Cup berth, as they continue to become the side no opposition relishes facing. Pardew was manager of the season two campaigns ago. He is again showing why. Jamie Jackson • Read the report: Manchester United 0-1 Newcastle • Moyes takes blame for Newcastle loss • Moyes tells United faithful he is not about to panic • Daniel Taylor: United must envy Arsenal midfield 'clones' • Pictures: the best images from Newcastle's victory 2) Martínez speaks just as impressively as Everton play It is probably a measure of Everton's improvement under Roberto Martínez that nobody blanched when he was asked whether the Champions League was now a realistic target. "To talk of league positions in December is foolish," Martínez replied. "But let's see where we are in April and where we can go after that. Everton, with it's history and tradition of nine titles in the past, should be looking to be in the Champions League." He spoke just as impressively as Everton had played and there is certainly good reason to be encouraged after a week that has seen them win at Manchester United and then hold the Premier League leaders to a draw. As Martínez said, Everton have overcome the "mental block" that has sometimes affected them when it has come to playing away against the top teams (the subtle implication about David Moyes was not lost on anyone). They have lost only once all season and, though he grabbed most of the attention, Ross Barkley was not the only player to excel against Arsenal. Seamus Coleman, Gareth Barry and James McCarthy were all identified for special acclaim by their manager and, in Barkley's case, Martínez did not recoil at all when he heard that Gary Lineker had likened him to Paul Gascoigne. The evidence was there for everyone to see. So, can Everton actually do it? "It will take time and we will need to be very creative but, long-term, Everton should be in the Champions League," Martínez said. "Maybe this season will be too early but that has to be our ultimate aim."

It is by no means obvious that Southampton needed to buy Victor Wanyama in the summer but they did and that has led to Cork being kept on the sidelines until Saturday, when he was cast into his first league start of the season against Yaya Touré, no less. He took a few minutes to get back up to speed with Premier League proceedings but soon he began to run the Southampton show in the middle. Touré did begin to look a little jaded as the game wore on – and City should definitely spare him Tuesday's trip to Bayern Munich, where the likelihood of them getting the 3-0 win they need to top the group is miniscule, especially compared to the need to have a fresh Touré against Arsenal next weekend – but that should not detract from the performance of Cork, who helped prove that there is depth to this Southampton squad. Paul Doyle • Read the report: Southampton 1-1 Manchester City • Osvaldo scorches Manchester City to warn England • Barney Ronay: don't scoff at Touré's notebook 4) Sterling arches back into reckoning Raheem Sterling turned 19 on Sunday after a week when his fortunes have been revived. The winger entered December with a solitary Premier League start this season, and even that was as a wing-back against Crystal Palace. Now he has begun three games in a row, scored against Norwich and leapfrogged Victor Moses in the queue for places. A month ago, Brendan Rodgers was considering loaning him out in January. Now it is apparent his short-term future lies at Anfield. Yet, excellent as he was against West Ham on Saturday, there is scope for improvement. Sterling could have had a hat-trick against the Hammers; instead, he still has only scored three goals in his league career. Richard Jolly • Read the report: Liverpool 4-1 West Ham United • Rodgers salutes Sterling and Allen after victory 5) Ireland stands out for Stoke While José Mourinho will want to forget Stoke's 3-2 victory against Chelsea in a hurry, Stephen Ireland is likely to treasure the match for some time. Having come on as an 18th-minute substitute for Charlie Adam, the midfielder played a crucial role in his side's triumph, scoring their second goal with a delightful curled finish before teeing up Oussama Assaidi for the stunning, late winner. "He is a good player, that is the top and bottom of it," said Stoke manager Mark Hughes of Ireland, who he signed on loan from Aston Villa in September having previously worked with the 27-year-old at Manchester City. "There's never been any doubt about Stephen's ability. In the past, for whatever reason, managers have seen different things in him – maybe they felt he was the wrong player for their club – but every time I have worked with Stephen he has been outstanding." There is no doubt that Ireland's career has been in drift for some time – having been named City's player of the season at the end of the 2008-09 campaign, he joined Villa the following summer as part of the deal that saw James Milner move in the opposite direction but failed to make an immediate impact there and was allowed to join Newcastle on loan in January 2011. Ireland didn't start a game at St James' Park before returning to Villa and now is on loan again. This time, however, things could be different, with Ireland getting opportunities to shine for a manager who clearly has faith in him. More displays like the one on Saturday and Ireland could finally re-establish the consistent level of performance that only a few years ago marked him out as one of the Premier League's best young talents. Sachin Nakrani • Read the report: Stoke City 3-2 Chelsea • Mourinho baffled why Chelsea strikers failed to quell Stoke 6) Spurs roll with lone ranger One striker, or two? That is the question on every Tottenham supporter's lips and André Villas-Boas already believes he knows the answer. Villas-Boas has been steadfast in his belief that his team should only have a lone man in attack, and in the last two games that has been Jermain Defoe. He could be right. The victory at Sunderland was not straightforward and despite their dominance in terms of possession and chances created, only an own goal from John O'Shea settled the outcome in Spurs' favour. Tottenham created a staggering number of opportunities on goal (22) during the 90 minutes to suggest the system does not necessarily need to change. It was always going to take time for the new-look squad to adapt after reinvesting the money from the sale of Gareth Bale to Real Madrid. Tottenham have scored two goals in each of their last three games, so they could be about to click. Gabriel Kerr • Read the report: Sunderland 1-2 Tottenham Hotspur • Poyet attempts to draw a line after Tottenham defeat 7) The new manager effect could yet have repercussions elsewhere Fulham's was a timely and impressive victory over Aston Villa, inspired as it was by Dimitar Berbatov's return to form and influence, to yield René Meulensteen's first success as a Premier League manager. The Dutchman has had an immediate effect since replacing his compatriot, Martin Jol. There had been improvement in defeat against Tottenham Hotspur in midweek, and there was urgency and conviction to their approach here. The same might be said of Tony Pulis at Crystal Palace, a team who have conceded once in a five-game run that has gleaned 10 points. Pulis' side have not been the crude, long-ball team many had envisaged they would become overnight, but have harried and hassled opponents to prompt their own mini revival. Both clubs hover just below the cut-off on goal difference and, while they can tackle the festive period with renewed optimism, the same might not be true of those just above them. If jittery chairmen witness the instant effects provoked by changes in the dug-out, surely the likes of Sam Allardyce at West Ham, or even Malky Mackay at an unpredictable Cardiff City, might be fretting. The period up to the mid-winter transfer window is treacherous for managers, as Jol has already discovered, and others will surely depart their clubs in the weeks ahead. Fulham, with Berbatov content and confident, boast enough experience to haul themselves clear of trouble. Meulensteen just needs to tap into their potential to succeed. Dominic Fifield • Read the report: Fulham 2-0 Aston Villa 8) Hammers in freefall Despite going down 4-1 at Liverpool, West Ham's goal difference is still keeping them out of the relegation zone. Given how impressive Fulham and Crystal Palace – two of the three sides below them – were in winning this weekend though, it's questionable how much longer their points total will be sufficient though. The Hammers' lack of goals in Andy Carroll's absence is a well-documented problem, but perhaps more concerning here for Sam Allardyce was their deference to Liverpool and Luis Suárez. To concede two own goals is bad, but West Ham's pride in their excellence at set pieces will have produced mountains of hubris during the fiasco that was Liverpool's second goal. James Collins' hash of an attempted clearance from Mamadou Sakho's weak volley was a stark signal to Hammers fans that their side are no longer any better than their relegation rivals, and that the team is in freefall.

Yet Bellamy had, apparently, overcome the hamstring injury which had kept him out since the loss at Aston Villa in early November. So why did Malky Mackay take the Welshman to London and exclude him from his squad? Talk in the press room after the match was that Bellamy had refused to get off the coach with his team-mates prior to the game. But Mackay, generally a straightforward manager who offers honest replies to the press pack, said there was no such drama. It's odd, though, because Cardiff have been in desperate need of proven striker lately and Bellamy was specifically rested in the 0-0 midweek draw with Stoke to spare him for the match at Selhurst Park. Cardiff's display against Palace was a prime example of their shortcomings up front and Andreas Cornelius, who came on as a sub, may prove to be £7.7m wasted. The Dane is considered a talented young striker, the proverbial 'one for the future', but that is not what Cardiff need this season. Survival in the Premier League can rest on having experienced goal-scorers in the matchday squad. Bellamy can't come back into the fold soon enough.

With Joe Hart still warming the Manchester City bench, most of the talk has been of Celtic's Fraser Forster as the best alternative should England require someone actually playing first-team football in Brazil. Norwich's John Ruddy is likely to be the third goalkeeper in the squad though, and will have done his prospects of actually getting a game or two for his country no harm with an inspired performance in the 2-0 win at West Brom. With the score at 1-0 he made an important save with his legs to deny Stéphane Sessègnon from close range, and later showed off his reflexes with a brilliant stop from Shane Long's glancing header. With Norwich in poor form, this was the ideal opportunity for Ruddy to remind Roy Hodgson of his not-inconsiderable qualities. The real question though is just how much he really fancies the prospect of facing Luis Suárez yet again.

Should Celtic keep their Champions League dreams alive with victory over Milan, they would also plunge the Rossoneri even further into crisis. Milan had cause to be grateful for some respite when landing in Glasgow on Monday evening. Some 400 furious supporters prevented the team bus from departing San Siro after the 1-1 draw with Genoa on Saturday. It took until midnight and for senior players, including Kaká, to address the irate crowd before calm was restored. "Speaking to fans wasn't a huge burden for me," Kaká said. "It is not something I am used to but as one of the senior players I have to get used to responsibility." The unrest is understandable. Milan sit 13th in Serie A, four points above the relegation zone and 20 adrift of the leaders, Juventus. Massimiliano Allegri's team have not won away from home all season or at all in their past seven matches. "It is only normal that the fans are disappointed but they are not the only ones," Allegri said. "The staff and the players share that disappointment. We have to do better. We have three objectives: to qualify from the Champions League group stage, in Serie A we have to improve and we have the Coppa Italia. Any other problems, the players don't have to worry about. They just need to stay focused." It seems apt that the infamous character of Mario Balotelli is caught in the midst of the turmoil. He and his team-mates have been branded "brats" by Milan's ultras, a theory hardly likely to subside amid reports Balotelli turned up late for training on Sunday. On Monday morning the Milan vice-president, Adriano Galliani, who had pleaded with fans to ease off with their protests, insisted Balotelli would not be sold. For supporters of Manchester City, this will seem a familiar scenario. "I think he'll enjoy it, you know," said the Celtic manager, Neil Lennon, of Balotelli's appearance in Glasgow. "I have seen him play at Old Trafford. City won 6-1 and he scored two and played brilliantly. "He played brilliantly the other night despite all the negative headlines coming out of the game. He missed a penalty but his play in general was really good. He is so strong and his first touch was very good. I think he had 13 attempts on goal, didn't score but, with the fact he was making chances for himself or getting on the end of things, he looked a top, top player." When reminded of Balotelli's negative alter ego, Lennon added: "I hope that Balotelli turns up tomorrow rather than the other one but you just never know." In general, Lennon is wary of pointing to Milan's troubles as a reason for hope. "The Champions League is important for Milan in a lot of ways," he explained. "I just feel that with the players they have and the mentality of the club then if they can prevail in the group stages their form will pick up automatically. "They have got a calibre of player and they like these nights. They like the Champions League and they have got the pedigree; they've got a backroom staff that have got four or five Champions League medals. So the whole structure of the club is geared towards the Champions League. It might not be a vintage Milan team but it's still an excellent side. They dominated the game against Genoa. For large passages of the game, Milan were excellent." In the specific context of Group H, Celtic know that they must win to retain aspirations of reaching the last 16. Should that happen and Ajax fail to defeat Barcelona, Celtic will head to their final group match at Camp Nou with their fate in their own hands. "It is win or bust for us," Lennon said. "I would like us to play really strongly at home and give the supporters something to really shout about. Whether that's enough on the night remains to be seen. "I will be looking more to the performance than the result. If we win the game and don't play well I will still be obviously delighted. But I am looking for a really strong performance as well." Lennon, who hinted he will hand his Dutch winger Derk Boerrigter a first Champions League start, will also have Kris Commons available. Commons' home was targeted by robbers as he slept during the early hours of Sunday, with two cars stolen from his driveway. "It was not a nice thing for Kris and his family to suffer,"Lennon said. "But I have spoken to him and he is totally focused on the game. What happened can be traumatic but Kris, being the strong-minded individual that he is, has brushed it all off."

If Portugal decide to record a song to accompany their passage to Brazil, maybe they will consider borrowing something from the Millwall pantheon in honour of their captain. No one likes him but he doesn't care, for Cristiano Ronaldo is going to the World Cup, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic is not. On the day that the Portuguese newspaper Diário de Notícias reported that Ronaldo is set to open a museum in homage to himself next year on his home island of Madeira – with the help of his mother Dolores – Portugal's totem onceagain proved that there is brilliance beneath the bluster, delivering them to a major tournament via the play-offs for the third time in a row with a clinical hat-trick. Ibrahimovic, the boy from the bad end of town who is now enough of a national treasure to merit a series of stamps bearing his image, scored twice and could have done little more to inspire Sweden. Yet the image of the night was the replay footage of Paris Saint-Germain's swashbuckling star simply applauding in the aftermath of Ronaldo's emphatically finished third goal, which killed the home side's challenge once and for all. So was this his greatest performance for Portugal? "If you take it on the level of the goals then yes," Ronaldo said with a coy arch of the eyebrow, "but I've put in other great performances before, even without scoring. I made my contribution, at the very highest level. We deserved to win, and now it's about enjoying the moment." He was right. There will be plenty of other times in the coming months for coach Paulo Bento to fret over Portugal's myriad flaws. "There's a lot to improve on," said Ronaldo but for now, friend and foe alike were compelled to join Ibrahimovic in admiration. It would be a surprise if the Ballon d'Or vote failed to follow suit. His team-mate Miguel Veloso, like Ronaldo a Sporting Clube de Portugal product, summed it up succinctly. "The quantity of games he plays," he said, "the goals he scores, the situations he resolves … Ronaldo is a machine." Johan Elmander was similarly convinced. "[Ibrahimovic] did everything he could," said the Norwich striker, "but Ronaldo was just that little bit better." He was so in a hostile environment too, as is the case so often on the road these days. The Friends Arena made it clear that it would not being living up to its name from the moment it loudly whistled Ronaldo's name as the starting lineups were read out to the crowd before the match, and the evening's events continued in a similar vein. He quickly resumed hostilities with Mikael Lustig after their clash in Lisbon on Friday, with the Celtic defender snatching the ball impatiently from the Portugal captain's hands after the award of a free-kick in the opening seconds. The main event, between Messrs Ibrahimovic and Ronaldo, was once again a slow burner in the first half. As is often the case for both, they seemed burdened with over-responsibility, trying to wrest the match to their individual wills single-handed. "I knew that the national team needed me in these two games," Ronaldo said after the whistle to the Portuguese broadcaster RTP, and it shows. While Sweden's talisman got sucked deeper and deeper to try to fill the creative void in midfield – just where Portugal wanted him – Ronaldo refused to look to pick passes. He wanted to grab the match by the throat. Ronaldo's tendency to this first surfaced midway through the first period, when he thrashed a cross-shot over from a tough angle with others better placed for a pass. He vigorously berated his teammates for not taking up better positions, drawing catcalls from the stands and the evening's first chants of "Messi, Messi". In among his 12 shots of the evening – three more than Sweden's team total of nine – the Real Madrid man almost created the opener for Hugo Almeida, but his recalled strike partner prevented a major incident from breaking loose by heading profligately into the side netting, with the hosts whistling for play to be stopped as Elmander lay injured. What seemed as if it would be the definitive Ronaldo moment of the evening arrived in the 51st minute, as he sped on to João Moutinho's visionary through pass to move clear and strike left-footed past Isaksson. The Portugal bench certainly thought so, celebrating wildly, jumping and cavorting on the pitch. Yet they needed him again after Ibrahimovic struck twice in four minutes, and this boisterous stadium caught the scent of blood. Portugal were panicking but their man reacted again, striking twice more in three minutes, in both cases from unforgiving angles. His last hat-trick, against Northern Ireland in Belfast, hauled Portugal out of a hole and took him past Eusébio's Portugal goal record. This one took him level with Pauleta, the national team's all-time leading scorer, on 47. It was another historic night for a historic player. His goal tally for the season is 32 from 22 matches, including five hat-tricks. Confronted with the fact that Portugal will now have participated in as many tournaments in his decade-and-a-bit with the senior team – three World Cups and three European Championships – as in the whole of the rest of the country's footballing history, Ronaldo was surprisingly understated. "It's a coincidence," he said, for once giving himself less credit than the public at large. On current form, it could become a running theme.

But what a result here for Leicester. And well deserved: they were much more incisive in attack, and Jamie Vardy’s first goal was truly magnificent. Liverpool looked good in possession, but their attacking play was deeply disappointing: they barely had a proper shot. Much for Jurgen Klopp to ponder, but Leicester keep on rolling. Congratulations to them, and thanks for reading. Goodbye. Arsenal drop points! But Man City win, 1-0 at Sunderland. So Leicester move on to 50 points, Man City on to 47, and Arsenal on 45, along with Tottenham, who won 3-0 at Norwich. Arsenal have about 90 seconds to find a goal to beat Southampton. It’s 0-0 at the minute, and unless they can score, the Gunners will be five points back of Leicester. Final moments elsewhere: Another victory for Leicester! What a story. What a team! 90 min + 3: That’s it! 90 min + 2: Kante wins a throw on the left side. He and Drinkwater have been brilliant. 90 min + 1: This is now eight league defeats for Liverpool, and it probably means they won’t qualify for the Champions League via their league position. Although it might have been a pipe dream in any case. The teams are just playing time. 90 min: Three added minutes. What’s the point?! 89 min: Liverpool have given up the ghost. They don’t look as though they’re going to score, to be honest. Ulloa is on for Mahrez, who is given a huge round of applause. 88 min: Jamie Vardy has never scored a hat-trick in league play: he scored two for Fleetwood in the Conference, but never in the Football League or Premier. He’s got two minutes to make history. 87 min: Firmino tries to go past Fuchs, but can’t do it, and Leicester break at pace. Kante is fouled by Lucas, who receives his customary yellow card. A change for each side: Firmino off, Teixeira on, and Okazaki is replaced by Andy King. 85 min: Huth is clattered by Allen as he heads one away for a corner. He’ll be OK, the big lummox. Milner’s ball is in cleared. 83 min: Benteke turns nicely, but the indefatigable Kante is in to nick it off his toe. Leicester’s work-rate is phenomenal. 81 min: Liverpool are pressing, but Leicester’s big blue door is bolted shut, so to speak. Clyne hits one from 20 yards, and it’s out for a corner. Leicester win the first ball, and then Schmeichel makes the catch. It’s just not happening for Liverpool! 79 min: Change for Leicester: Albrighton, who’s run his socks off, is replaced by Demarai Gray. 78 min: Liverpool just haven’t clicked in front of goal. Some nice approach play, but the final ball has been lacking – and the finishing has been dross. Twelve minutes to find something. 77 min: Headed clear, but Liverpool win it back. Firmino goes for goal from 22 yards. It’s blocked. That was the wrong option from the Brazilian. 76 min: Liverpool have to commit men forward, which leaves them vulnerable to Leicester’s pace on the counter. But that’s a corner, and Lallana rushes over to take it. 74 min: Lallana tries one from distance, and it’s miles over. Liverpool’s shooting today has been awful. Joe Allen comes on for Emre Can, and Jurgen Klopp looks pained. 72 min: What a player this guy is. Such instinctive work. It was just a long ball forward, but Sakho didn’t deal with, and Okazaki had a speculative go from 20 yards. It wasn’t going in, but it took a deflection, and Vardy just reacted quickest, beating a sleeping Lovren to it and stabbing over Mignolet with his left foot. Another goal for Jamie Vardy! Leicester, bloody hell! Vardy again, and Leicester lead by two! 69 min: Okazaki goes down in the box … but Andre Marriner says no! On the touchline, Ranieri looks perplexed – but there wasn’t too much of an argument from the home players. 66 min: Clyne went down the right hand side, crossed, and Can tried to poke it towards goal, but he couldn’t get the power, and Schmeichel saved easily. One of the lovely aspects of the goal was that Vardy didn’t have to take a first touch to control it: the pass from Mahrez was so pure, and Vardy read it so well, that the striker just allowed it to sit up, and then hit through it. Really, really great play. 65 min: Leicester have 10 players behind the ball. They’re defending extremely deeply. Moreno’s long switch for Henderson is out of play, and the KP Stadium goes “wahayyy!!” as it swerves out of play. Change for Liverpool, and Benteke is in for Henderson. 63 min: So now Leicester have the lead, and they don’t give up leads easily: they’ve only lost two league games all season. Liverpool need some inspiration. 62 min: That is a seriously excellent goal. Try to catch it on the highlights! Liverpool look vexed. 61 min: Just a stunning goal from Jamie Vardy. Mahrez hit a fantastic long pass for Vardy over the top, and the Leicester man was alive to it: he let it drop over his shoulder, allowed it to bounce, and just speared a sumptuous, dipping volley, first time, over Mignolet, who clutched thin air. It must have been 30 yards out – from an angle! Brilliant, brilliant play, and Leicester lead. Oh my word, what a goal! 58 min: Liverpool are dominating possession, but can’t quite work that clear chance. Firmino turns sharply, but his shot is too high. Activity on the Liverpool bench: is Benteke going to come in? 56 min: For a moment, Mahrez looked as though he was going to race clear, but Emre Can did well to hustle him off it. Moreno tries to embarrass Schmeichel from distance, but the Dane is wise to it, and beats out Moreno’s fierce shot. 53 min: They’ve played really nicely around the box, Liverpool, but haven’t quite managed to find a truly clear opening. Lucas shoots from 30 yards, and it’s miles over. It’s 170 games since he last scored, and you can see why etc etc etc. 51 min: Leicester have been pinned back in their half for much of this game, but they’re such a threat when they counter-attack. It doesn’t half help to have pace in your team, eh?! 50 min: Good area for Henderson to cross, but that’s too long. Rubbish! Leicester break, and Sakho’s clearance is poor, but Okazaki, after some nice feet to get round Lucas, fires one into the top tier. Groan. 48 min: Oh, Riyad! Leicester broke at pace, as their fashion, and suddenly they had a two on one … but Mahrez’s pass for Vardy was cut out! If he’d got that right, Vardy was totally in the clear. Actually, maybe the offside flag had gone up, but neverthless: Mahrez made a mess of that. 47 min: What an excellent move from Liverpool. Can to Milner to Henderson, and back to Can … but it’s just wide! Lovely clever work in the box, and Can was so close. 46 min: And Liverpool back on the attack. Leicester were momentarily worried, but Drinkwater does well, and the Foxes hammer it clear. Half-time scores here: Well, that was pretty decent: Liverpool possess the more refined style, but Leicester are such a threat when they break. Vardy has run the line very intelligently, and his cross for the Okazaki header was fabulous. Leicester have created the better chances, and Mignolet has made at least one excellent stop, but Liverpool have seen most of the ball, and were just beginning to move Leicester around at the end of that half. All to play for! See you shortly. 45 min +1: Headed clear, and that’s the half. 45 min: Only one minute of stoppage time, and Jurgen Klopp jabs an accusing finger at the fourth official. His team are on top, and he wants a goal before the break. Time for one last corner. 44 min: Leicester clear the danger, but they can’t make it stick up front. Liverpool pressing hard here. 43 min: Lallana cuts in and fires one towards goal, but Simpson gets in the way. It’s a corner. 42 min: Good spell from Liverpool: the passing is crisp, and Leicester can’t get hold of it. But then Moreno, who has seen a lot of the ball on this left side, gives it away, and Leicester can take a breather. 39 min: Ack, that was bad from Moreno: Firmino did really well to find him on the left hand side of the box, totally free, but his cross was dreadful, and hit straight out of play. That was a chance, because Leicester were stretched. 37 min: Another long throw from Fuchs. Liverpool clear. And another long throw! This time, Mignolet gets into difficulty, and drops it, but he was fouled surely? Ref says no! Hairy moments for Liverpool. Here’s Peter Oh:“Hi Tim, 20 minutes in and you haven’t typed the name “Firmino” even once! What gives?!” Yeah, he’s been quiet! 35 min: Fabulous save from Mignolet! Leicester looked long for Vardy, and although Liverpool won the first header, it sat up for Mahrez to hit, which he did, first time – but Mignolet tipped it over! That was a wonderful fingertip stop, and a super shot: it was heading in. Leicester can’t make the corner count. 34 min: Lovren wins it, but his header is straight up in the air, and Schmeichel claims, before aiming a volley of abuse at no one in particular. Like father, like son! 33 min: Trouble for Leicester: Mahrez was sloppy in possession, and lost it near the touchline. Moreno found Lallana, who produced some beautiful skill to go past Simpson, and his cross is headed behind as Henderson attacked it. Liverpool cranking up the pressure! 32 min: More end-to-end action, and the Reds win a corner on the left. Lovren and Sakho, Liverpool’s big defensive lumps, come up from the back. Leicester can’t clear, and it’s another corner! 30 min: Mahrez takes … and it’s into the wall. “The wall did its job!” scream bedroom commentators across the land. 29 min: Now this is a very good chance for Leicester, after Lucas clips Okazaki on the edge of the box. This is a much better angle for a shot. 28 min: This game has been really open and entertaining: two very different clashes of style, but Leicester should be ahead: Okazaki’s chance was golden. Corner to Leicester, and Mahrez takes, but Huth heads over. 26 min: Lovren fouls Vardy from behind, and it’s a clear foul, although Lovren disagrees. Chance for Leicester, 30 yards or so from goal. It’s maybe a bit far to have a direct shot, although Fuchs is eyeing it up. It is Fuchs, and it’s drivel: he didn’t get hold of it, and it rolls through to Mignolet. 24 min: Long throw from Fuchs, Huths wins the header, Liverpool can’t clear, and it falls to Simpson … whose shot is blocked, I think, by his own player. All a bit 1987-era Wimbledon for a moment. 22 min: Ooh, that was a chance for Liverpool: they had a four-on-four, and Henderson had the ball on the right side, but his cutback for Milner was slightly mishit, and Fuchs intercepted. A bit more care and Liverpool would have been in! 20 min: Liverpool are on top here, though: they’re really dominating possession. Milner, who has been prominent, cuts inside and shoots for goal. Simpson gets in the way and blocks it. Brave work: it hit him in the groin. 19 min: Another Liverpool corner. Milner takes, and it’s short again, but then Liverpool rather mess it up, and Leicester clear. Moreno looked inside for Henderson when he should have given it back for Milner. 18 min: It’s short, but nicely worked, and Lucas comes into the line at speed … and then immediately smashes out of play for a goal kick. O jogo bonito! 17 min: Lovely feet from Milner to get into the box, but Drinkwater is doughty, and comes across to cover before he can get his shot away. Better from Liverpool, this – they’ve pushed Leicester back deep in their own half, and now they’ve won a corner. 15 min: The game is so stretched already: Vardy plays right on the shoulder, and every time Leicester win it back in midfield Liverpool look vulnerable. 14 min: Nice effort from Mahrez: instant control to take down Fuchs’ high, hanging cross from the left, and a dipping volley that Mignolet had to save. Decent effort, all made by the quality of the touch. 12 min: And now a huge chance for Liverpool! Milner found Henderson, I think it was, who headed back across the goal, but Emre Can stabbed it straight at Schmeichel! Actually, Can was offside, so no alarms for Leicester, but regardless: the ball should have been in the net. 10 min: Two very good chances for Leicester in these first 10 minutes, but they’ll be cranky that they’re not ahead. Liverpool have been let off. 8 min: Oh, Okazaki should have scored! Liverpool coughed it up in midfield, Okazaki released Vardy, who completely burned Lovren on the left, and crossed for the Japanese … who headed straight at Mignolet! Great work from the goalie to get it up and over the bar, but that should have been 1-0. What a chance. 6 min: Ooh, that’s a bit naughty from Huth, a defender whose style of play might charitably be called uncompromising. It’s a free kick to Liverpool, but it might have been more: Huth seemed to catch Lallana on the jaw with a forearm! It wasn’t quite an elbow, or indeed a forearm smash, but it wasn’t the best piece of play from the German. 5 min: That’s the second time Vardy and Mahrez have linked up, but the Algerian was just hustled off it by Lucas before he could strike one at goal. Liverpool back in numbers to clear the danger. 3 min: Can cuts inside from the left and goes for goal, but it’s well over. Can looks to the heavens. 2 min: Mahrez goes close! Lovely cushioned header from Vardy, and suddenly Leicester were away: Mahrez picked the ball up, ran at the Liverpool defence in that easy, shuffling style, cut inside, and bent a shot just wide! Mignolet was at full stretch, and Liverpool were cut open there. Unlucky Mahrez! 1 min: Leicester get us under way, and the Leicester fans are singing loudly in East Midlands accents, me duck. And immediately they hump it forward, and win a throw. Fuchs hurls it in but Liverpool clear. A good, uncomplicated start! Here’s Tarek: “I didn’t know Teixeira is now a Liverpool player. Must be another Teixeira I’m sure.” Yah, Joao Carlos, who spend last season on loan at Brighton. He’s among the seven subs. We’re about six minutes away. The KP pitch looks lovely. Much better than Filbert Street! Here’s Steve Wingrove: “I noted in your preamble’ brief summary of Liverpool’s recent results that you neglected to mention that they are one of only two clubs to have actually beaten Leicester in the Premiership this season. Surely worth a mention this evening?” Yep, they sure did. And Christian Benteke scored! Refresh your collective memory here: Many, many other games are going on today: follow them here! So, Leicester are unchanged from the team that beat Stoke 3-0 – Jamie Vardy and Shinji Okazaki start up, and Riyad Mahrez, their standout player, has recovered some form after a little wobble over Christmas. Liverpool make a hatful of changes from the side that drew with West Ham: Mignolet, Clyne and Lovren keep their places, but everyone else is new. Roberto Firmino will play as the furthest forward player, with able assistance from Lallana and Milner. Leicester: Schmeichel, Simpson, Morgan, Huth, Fuchs, Mahrez, Kante, Drinkwater, Albrighton, Okazaki, Vardy. Subs: King, Gray, Ulloa, Dyer, Wasilewski, Chilwell, Schwarzer. Liverpool: Mignolet, Clyne, Lovren, Sakho, Moreno, Henderson, Lucas, Can, Milner, Firmino, Lallana. Subs: Toure, Benteke, Allen, Ibe, Flanagan, Ward, Teixeira. Referee: Andre Marriner (West Midlands) Well, the Premier League has chugged along into February, and no one has yet worked out how to stop Leicester City. The unfashionable East Midlanders are three points clear at the top of the table, and although we wise sages insist their fairy story must end soon, Leicester just keep doing what they do: defending stoutly, running hard, and playing on the counter-attack. The Foxes are going the distance, and today they host Liverpool with a chance to extend their lead to six points. Jurgen Klopp’s been at Anfield since October, and things still seem as uneven as ever at Liverpool: the Reds sit in seventh, having lost seven games already – they’re 13 points behind Leicester. Are they better now, or much the same? A place in the Champions League isn’t beyond them, but results have been erratic: a zany 5-4 at Norwich was followed by a 0-1 reverse against Stoke in the League Cup and a dreary 0-0 against West Ham on Saturday. What are we going to get today? Who knows?! Kick-off is 7.45pm local, and 2.45pm ET. Join us! Tim will be here shortly. In the meantime, read why some Liverpool fans are unhappy with the club’s ticket prices: “The outcome is extremely disappointing and a missed opportunity for LFC to lead in a fairer approach to ticket prices,” read a statement. “After months of time and effort, meetings and debate of ideas and plans to lower supporters’ costs, the owners have chosen to increase prices for many. In the context of the huge income rises the club will receive next year, to up their revenue from fans through season and match-day tickets is both unnecessary and morally unjustifiable. “At a time of ever increasing commercial and media revenues, the club’s reliance on ‘general-admission’ returns is diminishing, and this is a lost opportunity for LFC to begin the reversal of the effects of inflation-busting prices that have forced out many loyal fans over recent years. We had hoped to find a solution to better accessibility to Anfield for younger and future generations through reduced ticket prices.

The highlight of the evening, then, that wonder goal by Jamie Vardy. Leicester saw off Liverpool, as they habitually did in the 1960s, and 1980s, and 1990s, and ... Meanwhile Manchester City stay on their tails at the top of the Premier League. It’ll be first versus second when Leicester visit the City of Manchester Stadium at the weekend. Spurs move up to third above Arsenal, who dominated against Southampton but couldn’t break through. And it’s also a fine evening for Manchester United, who broke their first-half drought with some fine football against Stoke, and Bournemouth, who give themselves a little space to work with at the foot of the table. It’s been a blast. Leicester City, though, huh? What a team. Nighty night! And that’s the final goal of the evening, as the whistle blows at the Hawthorns! So here’s tonight’s full times ... Arsenal 0-0 Southampton Crystal Palace 1-2 Bournemouth Leicester City 2-0 Liverpool Manchester United 3-0 Stoke City Norwich City 0-3 Tottenham Hotspur Sunderland 0-1 Manchester City West Bromwich Albion 1-1 Swansea City West Ham United 2-0 Aston Villa An almighty scramble from a corner, one of those cartoon clouds with feet and fists sticking out of it, and Rondon prods a loose ball into the bottom right! What a sickener for the relegation-haunted Swans! Manchester United have beaten Stoke 3-0. Van Gaal walks very tall as he takes his leave of the Old Trafford dugout. And Bournemouth have won 2-1 at Palace. But Swansea won’t close out their victory, because ... Palace’s debut boy, Adebayor, has just flashed a shot into the right-hand side netting from six yards. So close to an injury-time equaliser, and a debut goal to go with the ones he scored while at Arsenal, Manchester City and Tottenham. But not this time. Here’s Jamie Vardy on his wonder goal against Liverpool: “To be honest I was looking all game, because he was quite far off his line.” Oh Mr Mignolet! Three games still being played. It’s effectively all over at Old Trafford, where Manchester United lead Stoke 3-0 and Louis van Gaal is in full cat-cream-interface mode. But it’s all to play for at the Hawthorns, where the Baggies still have ten minutes to turn around a 0-1 deficit against Swansea, and Selhurst Park, where Crystal Palace are trailing 2-1 against Bournemouth. Partick Thistle beat Motherwell with a last-minute Steven Lawless goal, by the way. Simon McMahon will be thrilled. Yep! Sergio Aguero’s goal was enough for City to see off Sunderland - but they had to defend with their backs to the wall for much of the second half. Here are the full times in the 7.45pm kick-offs: Arsenal 0-0 Southampton Leicester City 2-0 Liverpool Norwich City 0-3 Tottenham Hotspur Sunderland 0-1 Manchester City West Ham United 2-0 Aston Villa Arsenal couldn’t break through a staunch Saints defence. It’s full time at the Emirates: 0-0. Their rivals Spurs have won 3-0 at Norwich, and will go above Arsenal into third place on goal difference. They’re still playing at Sunderland. Can City hold on? It’s all over at the King Power: Jamie Vardy 2-0 Liverpool! They’ll stay top of the Premier League. A first title for the Foxes really could happen. It’ll be a little more likely if City are held to a draw at Sunderland: Otamendi has been forced into a last-ditch clearance at the Stadium of Light. Kane through one on one. No mistake. Spurs, like Leicester, are the real deal. Not over / over / not over. There will be six added minutes at Arsenal, where Fonte needed some serious running repairs to his noggin a while back. Liverpool haven’t looked like getting back into the game at the King Power since going two down at Leicester. And City will need to see out five extra minutes at Sunderland. Meanwhile here’s Simon McMahon: “Firhill for thrills, they used to say. Currently Partick Thistle 0 Motherwell 0. Both teams lucky to get nil by all accounts.” Arsenal have been pressing against Southampton. But Sanchez, in a bit of space in the box to the left of goal, is denied by Forster, a fine block. Up the other end, Gabriel gets away with a fairly obvious handball in the box. Arsenal certainly can’t afford a loss, with title rivals Leicester, City and Spurs closing in on wins. From a Villa corner, West Ham break upfield. Valencia, down the middle, finds Kouyate on his left. Kouyate takes a touch, strides into the box, and lifts a powerful effort into the top of the net! Game over against the ten men. The debutant Paloschi sets up Sigurdsson to break the deadlock with a drive past Foster. Francesco Guidolin on his way to making it three from three since taking over at Swansea! A marvellous save by Joe Hart from Jones at Sunderland, a shot heading for the top right turned round the post with a strong hand. Manchester City need to hang on here, with leaders Leicester on their way to another wonderful win against Liverpool. Leicester have a serious shout for a penalty kick, Okazaki going down under a pincer movement from Lovren and Moreno. But they’re not getting it. Meanwhile at Upton Park, Noble nearly settles it by whistling a first-time shot with the outside of his boot inches wide of Villa’s left-hand post. A slow-motion looping header. It’s fair to say nothing’s going right for Crystal Palace right now. Okazaki, down the inside-right channel, has a dig from the edge of the box. The ball deflects off the leg of the outstretched Lovren, to the left-hand side of the box, where Vardy dinks a delicious finish over the advancing Mignolet and into the right-hand side of the net. At the Stadium of Light, Sunderland’s Defoe has just planted his elbow on Otamendi. The referee doesn’t see it though. Meanwhile Ozil has just set up Koscielny, but the defender’s put that one over the crossbar. And now the pressure’s on, with Giroud missing another close-range header, and Ward-Prowse hacking an Ozil effort from the turn on the penalty spot off the line. Another wonderful team goal by United, who are on song now. Mata slips a pass down the left for Martial, who immediately slides a ball across the face of goal, allowing Rooney to tap home. United had the Stoke defence chasing shadows there. Simple but effective and very pretty. Could it be that Louis van Gaal knows a bit about football, do you think? Benteke’s on for Liverpool. Hm. Here’s Simon McMahon: “Drew Goldie talks a lot of sense (some might say too much sense for Clockwatch), but I think that if Dundee United can win their next two league games then, like weekday tea-times on ITV, the chase will be on. That’s a big ‘if’ though. But whoever finishes in the play off place in the SPFL will find it much more difficult against the team finishing second in the Championship this year. Talking of which, Anthony Stokes has just given Hibs the lead at Raith Rovers.” So this one looks a bit average as a result, but it’s a great goal in its own right, Antonio racing into the box down the right after a bouncing ball and guiding it first-time across Bunn and into the left-hand side of the net. They’ve deserved that lead, having recently bothered the crossbar as well. This is an astonishing goal! Vardy goes romping after a long Mahrez pass (hit on the turn!) down the right - and from the best part of 30 yards, sends a screaming dipping volley over Mignolet and into the right-hand corner! A slight question mark over Mignolet’s positioning off his line perhaps ... perhaps, if you’re being tight ... but then who’d have expected Vardy to take that, the ball dropping over his shoulder? No, no, you can’t blame Mignolet for that. That’s a wonder strike. That’s ... dare I say ... Robbie Fowler-esque. Norwich haven’t done much to get back into the match against Spurs at Carrow Road. But suddenly! First Naismith flashed a subtle header wide of Lloris’s goal, the closest they’ve come. And then even closer! Naismith swivels and shoots from close range, but his effort is blocked. Bassong follows up to bother the net, but he’s offside. Spurs clinging onto their two-goal lead a little. Still no breakthrough at the Boleyn. But West Ham are finally turning the screw on ten-man Aston Villa. Richards hoicks clear from his own area with four West Ham men bearing down on him. Then Noble creams a dipping volley towards the bottom right, but Bunn parries magnificently. Meanwhile at Arsenal, Mane misses another gilt-edged chance, having been put through on goal but managing to make an awful pig’s lug of it. A lively start to the second half at the King Power. Can dragged a shot wide left of the Leicester goal, then Mahrez made a balls of a quick-break upfield with Liverpool all over the shop. And at the Emirates, Giroud curled a majestic effort towards the top right, but Forster somehow clawed it out, brilliant play all round. And the other two half-time scores in the 8pm kick-offs: Crystal Palace 1-1 Bournemouth West Bromwich Albion 0-0 Swansea City A half-time scoreline that’s worth the standalone treatment: Manchester United 2-0 Stoke City Zaha is perhaps fortunate to still be on the pitch for Crystal Palace against Bournemouth. He received a yellow card for giving the linesman pelters over a corner/goal-kick decision, then nearly copped for a second one by attempting to engage the referee in a full and frank exchange of views. A lenient Mike Jones told the silly sod to calm and pipe down, with a little help from Palace captain Jedinak. Juan Mata has just missed a sitter for Manchester United. Darmian twists and turns down the right, before sending a perfect inswinger onto the head of the little man. He’s got to score, but somehow blasts his header from six yards miles wide right. That’s a dreadful miss. Mata cocks his head back and smiles ruefully. It’s impossible to be angry with that face. Meanwhile it’s half-time in all the Premier League 7.45pm kick-offs: Arsenal 0-0 Southampton Leicester City 0-0 Liverpool Norwich 0-2 Tottenham Hotspur Sunderland 0-1 Manchester City West Ham United 0-0 Aston Villa Not too many goals there. All of which is making the 8pm kick-offs look quite the scene. The latest scores, 30-odd minutes into the first half, are as follows: Crystal Palace 1-1 Bournemouth Manchester United 2-0 Stoke City West Bromwich Albion 0-0 Swansea City The Cherries, pretty in pink tonight, are level at Selhurst Park. Pugh has danced this way and that before planting an effort home. Palace, struggling of late, couldn’t hang onto that lead for very long. Rangers have just taken the lead at Raith, a 44th-minute goal by Andrew Halliday, which I mention as an excuse to print this email from Drew Goldie: “I’m not massively confident that Dundee United gubbing Killie 5-1 is a sure sign of resurgence, but it’s going to be an interesting month with fixtures against Motherwell and Hamilton (and ironically, the Jags in the Cup). I don’t know if Mixu is either. The bottom of the Scottish Premier is fascinating because second bottom will play the winners of the Championship playoff, and whereas Hibs sank like a stone and went down to Hamilton who were on a high, Motherwell totally outclassed Rangers last year because they were playing against good teams week in and out, whereas Rangers had little to bite into when beating Dumbarton and Alloa (occasionally) and the like. Every time Kilmarnock look like they’re defenestrating, they come up with a result. Ah me. This might be the last Premiership season in Scotland we can actually talk about the football, so I’m making the most of it.” Zaha makes good down the right flank, whips a cross into the area, and Dann opens his body to sidefoot powerfully home. Palace on course to break their four-match losing run in the league. Southampton should be leading at Arsenal. Mane races after a Long header down the middle, and he’s free in the area. But with Cech quickly off his line, he panics, and squirts a lame effort past the keeper and wide of the right-hand post. Mane has the good grace to look pained as he trots back upfield. What a chance that was! Old United are back! And it’s a classic. A wonder strike. A pitch-length move down the right involving Carrick and Rooney, who hoicks the ball to the other flank for Martial. The young man steps inside, and pass-lashes a Thierry Henry-esque creamer into the top right from the edge of the area. That’s as good a team goal as you’ll see all season. Looks like LVG might have a plan after all? Simon Mignolet, not for the first time today, has made a save for the ages. This is probably worth recording, seeing the amount of stick the man gets for his admittedly erratic performances. A reminder that Tim Hill is your go-to guy. Manchester United boring? Oh I don’t think so. Martial nearly makes it two, cutting in from the left and finding the side netting when he should have at least made Butland work. Then down the other end, Crouch causes all sorts of bother, while Bojan twice causes a problem down the inside-right channel, but is bundled out of it first by Borthwick-Jackson and then by De Gea. The entertainers. Norwich haven’t had a kick yet. Alli was preparing to knock a chance home from six yards, but he’s bundled over by Bassong. No card, but that’s a penalty, and Kane makes no mistake from the spot. Manchester United score IN THE FIRST HALF AT OLD TRAFFORD! It’s their first first-half goal in 12 home games. Lingard is the hero, a diving header from close range, putting away a fine left-wing cross from Borthwick-Jackson. Good news for City fans: Aguero is up and about, scooting around in his usual fashion. No serious injury. And no news from the three 8pm kick-offs either. The matches have started, though, there is that. Another great chance for Ozil at the Arsenal! A deep right wing cross drops to his feet on the edge of the six-yard box. He’s clear, and onside! But he kung-fu-kicks the ball straight at Forster, who nevertheless has to make a splendid split-second save from close range. Meanwhile here’s Simon McMahon from o’er the border: “A few important games in Scotland tonight, not least at Firhill where Partick take on Motherwell. The bums of the losers of that one will be getting squeakier by the minute as they look over their shoulder at a resurgent Dundee United side ready to swiftly climb the table. A draw wouldn’t be bad for the Tannadice men either. So it cocktails all round whatever happens. In the Scottish Championship it’s Raith v. Rangers and Morton v. Hibs.” If he doesn’t follow this up, he’s just been a great big tease. Ayew has elbowed Cresswell in the mushki, while battling for a throw-in. His manager’s going to love him. Villa had been the better team in the early exchanges. In the middle of a desperate relegation battle, and all. What a business. Navas fires a cross into the Sunderland box from the right. Nobody bothers to clear. Aguero, at the far post, takes a touch and belts home. But he’s injured by Jones in the act of scoring, the Sunderland man scraping his studs down the back of the striker’s leg. Aguero’s down getting treatment. Ozil has come close to opening the scoring at the Emirates. Zipping into the area down the inside-left channel, he takes a ball dropping over his shoulder down with one gorgeous touch, but shoots straight at Forster. A bit more composure, and we’d have a Bergkampesque stunner on our hands there. Okazaki should have put Leicester a goal up against Liverpool. Vardy crosses from the left, perfectly onto his strike partner’s nut, six yards out. But Okazaki heads straight at Mignolet, who gets to reprise Bruce Grobbelaar’s finger-tipped effort from Alan Hansen at the 1986 FA Cup final. Falling backwards, he tips over the bar. And that’s that. Meanwhile at West Ham, Villa are claiming a penalty as Agbonlahor causes bother in the Hammers box, only for a rogue arm to pad the ball out of his road. Nothing going for poor Villa. It’s been a bright start for Southampton at Arsenal, with Ward-Prowse curling a long-range free-kick dipper towards the bottom right. Cech turned the ball round the post, and the corner came to nothing. Meanwhile at Leicester, Huth has just crumped an elbow into Lallana’s startled coupon. Accidental, but a free kick, which is easily cleared from a packed box by the head of Morgan. Mahrez wasn’t far away from scoring the evening’s first goal, for Leicester against Liverpool at the King Power. But his long-range shot curls an inch or two wide of the bottom-left corner. Instead, the plaudits go to Dele Alli at Carrow Road, who slots home from close range to put in-form Spurs ahead. The games at Arsenal, Leicester, Norwich, Sunderland and West Ham are underway! Here’s to a few good old-fashioned goalfests. Before we get going, a reminder that Tim Hill is on detailed MBM duty for the big game between top-of-the-table Leicester City and Kloppo’s Amazing Travelling Circus. Leicester’s last league game was a 3-0 home win over Stoke; Liverpool’s was that absurd 5-4 victory at Norwich. So anything could happen here. An 11-goal thriller, please! Arsenal v Southampton: Alexis Sanchez makes his first start in two months for the Gunners. James Ward-Prowse returns to a Saints team coming off the back of a win at Old Trafford. Crystal Palace v Bournemouth: Emmanuel Adebayor is on the Palace bench, itching to make his debut. Bournemouth welcome back Matt Ritchie. Leicester City v Liverpool: Shinji Okazaki has been passed fit for Leicester. The visitors bench FA Cup star Christian Benteke. Manchester United v Stoke City: Matteo Darmian and Michael Carrick return for the home side. Stoke, a promising season suddenly over in the last week, keep Xherdan Shaqiri on the bench. Norwich City v Tottenham Hotspur: Timm Klose makes his debut for Norwich, while Dele Alli is back for Spurs. Sunderland v Manchester City: Lamine Kone makes his debut in a new-look back line for Sunderland. City go with the in-form Kelechi Iheanacho up front. West Ham United v Aston Villa: James Tomkins, who took a whack upside the noggin the other evening at Anfield, is back for the Hammers. Villa welcome Gabby Agbonlahor to the first XI once more. West Bromwich Albion v Swansea City: Darren Fletcher returns for the Throstles, while Alberto Paloschi sits on the bench for the Swans, hoping to make his debut.

Arsène Wenger will agree a new contract with Arsenal in the near future and is set to be significantly backed in the summer transfer window after the club announced on Monday a record £150m kit deal with Puma, which lasts until 2019. Wenger has hinted in recent weeks that a contract extension is not far off, despite admitting last summer that his future was not 100% certain, and the Arsenal chief executive, Ivan Gazidis, said on Monday that he was convinced that the Frenchman would commit to the club. Gazidis, speaking at the Emirates Stadium during the unveiling of a lucrative kit deal with Puma worth £30m a season for the next five years, said Wenger would remain at the helm and be supported in the transfer window as Arsenal strive to compete with the top clubs in Europe. "We've always supported Arsène and Arsène has always been committed to this football club," Gazidis said. "Arsène will be extending with us and at the right time we will make that announcement. "He's always been completely committed to this football club, it's the football club of his life so we're convinced at the right time we'll quietly make an announcement and he's the right person to see us forward. I'm convinced of that." Puma have required the rights to produce Arsenal-branded merchandise, as well as the club's training and first-team kits, in a deal that ends the club's 20-year affiliation with Nike, whose current contract expires at the end of the season. Though direct comparisons can be difficult due to the fine print of deals, Arsenal's Puma deal eclipses Liverpool's £25m-a-year contract with Warrior. Real Madrid's contract with the German brand Adidas is worth £31m a year while Barcelona's deal with Nike earns them £27m per annum. On the kit deal, Gazidis added: "The money from this deal will be available to the club from this summer. This represents another important step forward in Arsenal's progression on and off the pitch. "It's a validation of the things we're doing right. Our club has walked an independent path of standing on our own two feet and thinking long term about our progression. It's to be able to invest in our squad and it's a very important step for our progression on the pitch. "We have a vision to be competing at the top of the world's game. We're not where we want to be yet but we want to be competing with the best clubs in the world. We're doing it our way, without relying on any single individual." Following a lengthy period of criticism for not spending large sums on major signings, Wenger broke Arsenal's transfer record last summer with a £42.5m deal for the Germany attacker Mesut Özil. Schalke's Julian Draxler, another Germany forward, has been heavily linked with a £37m move during the January window. Arsenal, who hold a one-point lead over Manchester City at the top of the Premier League, play Southampton at St Mary's on Tuesday evening but are set to be without Jack Wilshere who is carrying an ankle injury. In recent seasons February has proved a tough month for the north London club, when chances of silverware have been dashed by exits in various cup competitions, and the next few weeks provide a number of serious challenges for Wenger's side. Next month Arsenal play Liverpool in the league and FA Cup, Manchester United in the league and Bayern Munich in the last 16 of the Champions League. Wenger is confident that his side can withstand the tough spell without wilting as they have done in the past, although he questioned the role of TV companies when contributing to the buildup of games in quick succession. He said: "In one week you can go out of everything. We went to Barça [in 2011] and went out on away goals, three days later we lost to Man United in the FA Cup because we had the disappointment of Barça. That's part of it. "In the other leagues they do help teams. I've already suggested in Uefa meetings to make sure that in Champions League competitions that the teams have the same amount of rest. In some championships, for example in Portugal, they cancel the [domestic] games. The game before the Champions League, they cancel the game. "It is the television today who decides, I cannot even blame the Premier League because it's the television who has the last word. If they say we want Arsenal v Liverpool on Sunday, it will be on Sunday. I can understand the television, but the question you can ask is the way it is sold, sometimes you [could] take £50m less and keep the command."

Sam Allardyce had mused after West Ham United's Capital One Cup quarter-final win at Tottenham Hotspur, in the knowledge that it would be Manchester City next, that the competition's format had a flaw. "It is a shame," the West Ham manager said, "that the semi-final cannot be over one leg." He suggested that West Ham might have a chance if that one-off tie were at Upton Park. The events here did little to strengthen the hypothesis. Yes, this semi-final was already over, after the mauling that City handed out in the first leg but the manner in which they strolled to victory suggested that they would be happy to play West Ham whenever and wherever. City looked sharp, even as they played within themselves and the only question, from the moment that Álvaro Negredo nodded them into an early lead, was the number of goals that they would deign to score, how severely they would punish West Ham. An utter rout appeared to be on but City settled on three, making nine overall, with Sergio Agüero, who returned to the starting XI, and Negredo, again, doing the damage. The strikers were in remorseless mood and they were helped by a thrusting performance from the 18-year-old Brazilian-born Portuguese winger Marcos Lopes. City's confidence is overflowing and they will surely hope that Manchester United, rather than Sunderland, emerge from the other semi-final to be the opposition in the Wembley final on 2 March. City took their goal tally for the season to 106 in all competitions. They are unbeaten in 18 matches. And, most tantalising of all, they remain in contention for all four trophies. "I'm proud," Manuel Pellegrini, the manager, said. "We are the only team still in all four. I have never been to Wembley as a manager, so it is special. We just want to continue with our ambition." Gallows humour framed this occasion. West Ham boasted only one hat-trick in the team and that was Roger Johnson with his three relegations. Forget City's quest for the quadruple. The defender is on for his own version. A local bookmaker advertised the return on a 7-0 West Ham win in his window beforehand: the keys to the shop. "Being realistic," Allardyce wrote in his programme notes, with glorious understatement, "we are unlikely to overturn our first-leg deficit." West Ham, and only West Ham, had been in this situation before. In 1990 they crashed to a then League Cup semi-final record 6-0 defeat to Oldham Athletic. A line for the historians: they won the return leg 3-0. The West Ham nightmare continued after two minutes and 36 seconds and Allardyce was left to rage at the lack of marking that presented Negredo with a free header in front of goal. Perhaps it was Agüero's presence inside the area that brought on James Tomkins' brain-fade. Either way, it was negligent in the extreme of the West Ham centre-half to drift away from Negredo and he headed Lopes's left-wing cross beyond the exposed Jussi Jaaskelainen. The attendance was recorded at 14,390 but with tickets still pricey, the real surprise was that so many turned up for such a hopeless cause. There was no cup fever, only angst from Allardyce, which deepened with the losses through injury of Joe Cole and Mohamed Diamé. Cole tweaked a groin and Diamé departed on a stretcher in the last minute after banging his knee. Allardyce said Diamé's problem might not be as bad as it looked but the frustration was everywhere. Allardyce urgently wants reinforcements for the quest to hit his target of 22 points from the remaining 16 Premier League matches to dodge relegation but he seems to be hitting brick walls. "I would not have a clue," he said, when asked about the prospects of January purchases. "Every time I get a signing, somebody else takes him." West Ham were close to a deal for Monaco's Lacina Traoré – Allardyce even attended the work permit hearing – but the striker is now bound for Everton. Other players have turned down West Ham, including Everton's John Heitinga. City's second came after another burst from Lopes. The ball broke to Agüero, who did not look the favourite to get past Razvan Rat and Matt Taylor but he did, due to hapless defending. He tapped past Jaaskelainen as though on the training ground. Agüero had earlier been denied from a distance by the goalkeeper. Allardyce got 45 minutes out of Andy Carroll, on the striker's first start of the season, and he put himself about, particularly in the air. Kevin Nolan, back from a four-match ban, had the ball in the net on six minutes only to be correctly pulled back for offside. West Ham sought the most hollow of consolations in the second half and there were flashes from Ravel Morrison of his touch and mazy dribbling. He had two decent appeals for penalties overlooked and the substitute Carlton Cole twice went close. Yet the evening was summed up by Diamé running at Carlton Cole inside the City area and neither player changing directions and, shortly afterwards, Negredo running in between Johnson and Taylor as though they did not exist before stretching to scoop past Jaaskelainen. "Nine-nil in your cup final," taunted the City fans. West Ham wanted to raise confidence and restore pride. They failed.

THE FIVER FOXES IT UP, YET AGAIN The 2015-16 Premier League champions, then. Manchester City have no boss for the rest of the season, so their players will have their feet on the desk for the next six months. Arsenal are Arsenal. Lads, it’s Tottenham. And nobody in their right mind is taking a shower like Ed Woodward’s Manchester United seriously, just because they’ve got the weight of history behind them: if that’s where you’re coming from, pops, you may as well waste your money on sepia-toned former greats such as Huddersfield Town, The Wednesday, Preston North End or Liverpool. It’s just not going to happen. So by default as much as anything else, it’s got to be West Ham Un … hold on … it’s got to be Leicester City, hasn’t it? The Foxes boast several excellent players, have a brilliant team ethic and can call on a well-balanced squad. Their manager is as wily and level-headed as they come. Pretty much everyone outside of Nottingham and Coventry are willing them to do well. In fact, the only thing going against Leicester right now is this paragraph of text, The Fiver being cursed with a reverse Midas touch certain to see the Foxes lose their upcoming tricky run of fixtures against Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal by an aggregate score of 0-143. But this 17-year run of risibly incorrect predictions has to end at some point, surely, and that time may as well be now. So Leicester for the league it is, then, starting with nine points from the next nine. You’re welcome. Leicester’s hopes have certainly been boosted by a very decent transfer window: not only have the mooted defections of Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez failed to materialise, the club have also resisted the temptation to fritter away ludicrous sums of cash on utter rubbish just to keep a few journalists sated and irritants on Twitter quiet. That feelgood factor continued apace on Tuesday, with news that Vardy will sign a new deal that will give the striker a much-deserved pay hike and keep him at the club until 2019. With Chelsea and Liverpool having reportedly shown an interest, Vardy’s long-term commitment suggests he envisions something very special happening at Leicester, very soon. In which case, The Fiver would like to wish him all the best in his quest, and also apologise profusely for the previous 156-word block of text that has almost certainly scuppered everything. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Tim Hill from 7.45pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Leicester City 0-49 Liverpool, while Scott Murray will be on hand for … deep breath … Arsenal 2-2 Southampton, Norwich 1-3 Tottenham, Sunderland 1-2 Manchester City, West Ham 3-1 Aston Villa, Crystal Palace 2-2 Bournemouth, Manchester United 0-0 Stoke City and West Brom 1-1 Swansea City.

Not for City the tired ‘no disrespect to …’ with Manuel Pellegrini; they’ve instead adopted ‘out of respect for …’ as their official phrase of dismissiveness.

Guus Hiddink has judged John Terry’s recent performances to be perfect and insisted the “door is not closed” for the captain to extend his Chelsea career into a 19th senior season despite the player having drawn his own conclusions at the lack of urgency over contract negotiations. Terry will start Wednesday’s awkward Premier League game at Watford, making his 697th appearance for the club in the process, having spoken at length to Hiddink since opting to reveal he anticipates this being his last campaign at Stamford Bridge. The 35-year-old perceives the club to be waiting to discuss his situation with their new manager in the summer and no new deal is on the table despite Branislav Ivanovic recently being given a 12-month extension. The centre-half therefore anticipates ending a 21-year association with Chelsea in May and, having entered the last six months of his contract, is free to negotiate with foreign teams and lucrative offers are anticipated from China, the Middle East and, possibly, Major League Soccer. Yet Hiddink has spoken to Terry and is assured his commitment will not waver in the games ahead, with those talks having addressed the thorny issue of when the player’s spell at the club is coming to an end. Hiddink said: “We spoke about it. For every player or manager, the age comes when you have to say goodbye. You have to ask yourself if that is happening. It’s difficult. At a lower level, I can help him prepare: I had the same experience because I loved the game so much and, when you’re quitting, it’s difficult. My manager told me to step off the pitch when I was 36. Sometimes you don’t see it yourself. I must say John is doing perfectly in his performances, so I’m not suggesting anything, but we spoke about things. He can carry on, of course. He’s fit. His ambition is enough to carry on.” The interim manager has had that kind of awkward conversation before. “With a few players in clubs and also national teams, where I had to say: ‘It’s time to say goodbye.’ It’s very difficult because those are legends, big players, and stopping hurts a player. Whatever your job is afterwards, if you were so passionate about playing football, whatever you do afterwards is a substitute for what you did and what you love. You can put yourself in the boots of those players. “Here at Chelsea, you mention Didier Drogba [whose second spell at the club ended last summer], and these are people who have had a huge impact on the pitch. That’s where it has to happen. But, on top of that, they have a presence within the group in the dressing room. [If Terry does leave] it will be a new situation, if it happens. But let’s see what will happen in the short term, and if there are new leaders coming up in the group. Theoretically, no one is irreplaceable. But John has a huge impact: he has had that in recent games and he will do in the upcoming games, both in the dressing room and out on the pitch.” Hiddink indicated after the 3-3 draw with Everton, when Terry scored an early own-goal only to salvage a point with a stoppage-time equaliser, he would advise the board to retain the centre-back beyond the summer. He has also recommended the influence Terry may have on the coaching staff, particularly in inspiring the next generation of players to emerge from the club’s academy. He said: “But generally I recommend what I think and people can do as they like. But it’s not a closed door. It was a bit surprising [that Terry chose to announce publicly no offer would be forthcoming] but he’s entitled to do what he did given his contract expires at the end of the season. “On the other hand, the club still want to have the dialogue and to have an open door still. No specific decision was made yet. You have to see what’s coming up with the transition of the new manager as well. So the door is not shut and dialogue is always possible.”

For Arsenal a tremor that started as a festive flinch has turned into a full-on winter wobble. A goalless draw with Southampton on a fretful night at the Emirates leaves Arsène Wenger’s team without a goal in their past three league games and with a title challenge that looks increasingly snarled in the midwinter gloom. Fraser Forster was brilliant, a goalkeeper who combines prodigious size and brawn with a balletic agility producing a full range of saves from the athletic to the instinctive. But Arsenal were also lacklustre for the first hour and hesitant in their finishing even as the chances began to flow, with an attack that looked more than ever like one elite German playmaker plus a group of mid-ranking hopefuls. Despite a blizzard of chances in the final 20 minutes Southampton were largely undisturbed, with Forster a thrillingly resolute yellow wall. “He was magic,” Ronald Koeman purred. Four points clear of Manchester City on Christmas Day, Arsenal now find themselves in fourth place having won two of their past seven league games, a run that began with the 4-0 Boxing Day defeat by Southampton. Wenger’s excuses this week for that flaccid performance – “it was Christmas” – seemed a little odd, but they came with the promise Arsenal would look to start with purpose here. Or not, as it turned out. There are times where the more potent atmosphere of a smaller, less commercially accessible stadium might be a genuine asset to this team. Instead, in almost total silence from London’s largest home crowd, it was Southampton who began with more composure, James Ward-Prowse drawing an early save from Petr Cech with a driven free-kick. Arsenal made seven changes from the FA Cup victory against Burnley, the most notable the return of Mesut Özil to start alongside Alexis Sánchez for the first time since November. It was Özil who had Arsenal’s first chance with 12 minutes gone, running on to Sánchez’s floated pass and taking the most beautiful stone-dead touch only for Forster to save well with his legs as he shot. Southampton came to the Emirates having not conceded a goal in 200 minutes of league football, and they looked intent on keeping it that way with Oriol Romeu and Victor Wanyama a muscular double bolt in midfield. Arsenal went wide, Héctor Bellerín skating outside Cédric Soares and producing a fine cross that Olivier Giroud headed back across goal. Özil flicked towards an apparently gaping net from five yards out only to see Forster, spreading his arms, produce a genuinely stunning save. With half-time approaching Özil was again crowded out inside the six-yard box after good work from Joel Campbell. But it was Southampton, composed in defence and intermittently energetic in support of Shane Long, who looked the happier team at the break. Arsenal returned energised – these things are relative – and almost scored straight away, Forster again outstanding. This time it was after a fine driving run by Ramsey, Forster leaping high, superhero-style, to palm away Giroud’s hooked shot. Still, though, Romeu, Wanyama and Ward-Prowse kept a grip on central midfield, while Sadio Mané flickered at the other end. Giroud looked cumbersome linking the play, Campbell energetic but vague. With Sánchez still finding his gears and Ramsey filling a hole in central midfield, Wenger’s starting team here looked alarmingly dependent on Özil for creativity. Theo Walcott came on just past the hour mark, a man for a crisis perhaps, but a man also with one Premier League goal since September. Walcott drew a double save from Forster, the first a weak low shot with time to think, the second a thrash at chest height. Moments later Laurent Koscielny headed Özil’s fizzed cross over the bar from three yards out. Suddenly the chances were coming. Romeu kicked off the line after Sánchez’s neat turn and poked shot. Özil and Sánchez combined only for Forster, again, to claw the ball away. Chasing a goal at the last Wenger sent on Francis Coquelin who was immediately booked for an angry tackle on Long. Six minutes of added time brought a strangled roar of hope from the home fans but Southampton remained spiky and resilient to the end. Arsenal will feel they should have won this match, but there has been a sense of declining momentum about them since Christmas. Missing Santi Cazorla’s guile – and to a lesser degree the urgency of Jack Wilshere and Danny Welbeck – it seems increasingly odd even the famously parsimonious Wenger could look at this squad over two transfer windows and decide against going all-out for a first-team-ready outfield player. With new arrivals, new eras, fresh rounds of likely acquisitions announced elsewhere in the Premier League this week, it was a particularly galling night to come up short again.

No January purchases, no Jan Vertonghen, no problem for Tottenham Hotspur. Not here, at any rate. This was a suave demonstration of Spurs’ intention to sustain their challenge at the top of the Premier League. Even before Dele Alli shot them into the lead in the second minute the visitors looked a class above Norwich, two goals from Harry Kane garnishing a victory that enabled Mauricio Pochettino’s men to leapfrog Arsenal into third place in the table and left Norwich grasping for security at the other end. A place in next season’s Champions League would be a fine achievement for Spurs but performances like this suggest an even greater feat is within their reach, as do the bare facts: they are five points behind the league leaders, Leicester City, have not lost away since the opening day of the season and the margin of their win here gave them the best goal difference in the league. Spurs’ fans can dream, especially as their manager can be counted on to ensure the players’ minds do not wander. “We are very calm,” said Pochettino. “We showed maturity and consistency here but this has been the key since the beginning of the season. We cannot get distracted by the table. It’s important to arrive in the last few games with the possibility of fighting but we have a long way ahead.” Norwich may not be the most fearsome opponents but this was set up to be a serious test for Spurs, being their first league match since the loss of Vertonghen to a knee ligament injury. For the first time in the campaign, then, Vertonghen could not partner Toby Alderweireld in central defence. Kevin Wimmer was given his first league start instead and produced a display that suggested the break-up of the Belgian partnership need not be ruinous. Norwich’s defence, on the other hand, remains in tatters despite the fact that they, too, started with a new centre-back here, Timm Klose, bought last month from Wolfsburg, making his debut. It took Spurs 100 seconds to expose the problems that remain in the home defence. A shot by Alderweireld was cleared only as far as Christian Eriksen, whose curling effort from 20 yards was spilled by Declan Rudd. Alli reacted faster than Sébastien Bassong to stab the ball into the net from close range. “We worked all week on the back four and then we concede in a minute and a half,” said an annoyed Alex Neil. Spurs went on to lord it over their hosts. They looked stronger, slicker and more imaginative, and created several chances to prove that on the scoreboard. Alderweireld went close with a free header before Son Heung-min flicked a cross from Kane into the side-netting. Pochettino craved another goal to confirm his team’s dominance and it arrived on the half hour, albeit after a contested penalty decision. Alli went down in the box after beating Bassong to a rebound off Rudd from a shot by Kane, who rammed the penalty into the net. Four minutes later Kane almost scored again but his ferocious shot from the left cannoned back out off a post. Alli should have made it 3-0 before the break after dashing into the box undetected by any Norwich defender, but the 19-year-old headed Danny Rose’s cross wide from eight yards. Norwich’s hope of staging a comeback looked faint, even more so when they were denied a penalty after Steven Naismith went down under a challenge from Wimmer. Alli was replaced by Nacer Chadli at half-time. “He felt unwell, but now he’s OK,” Pochettino explained later. “We will assess him on Wednesday but the signs are good.” The signs are not so encouraging for Norwich, who, despite a second-half improvement, ended up convincing losers. Kane scored on the break in the last minute, moments after hitting the post from a similar move. That was the 17th goal that Norwich have conceded in their last four matches, proving that despite personnel changes the team has yet to plug big gaps at the back. Neil’s exasperation is clear. “If we as a squad don’t realise quickly that we need to get our fingers out, then its going to be tough” he said. The Scot was also miffed at the response he got from the referee, Kevin Friend, after complaining about several decisions made during the game. “Kevin’s response was ‘Yeah, it’s my fault’,sarcastically,” said Neil, who did not claim that the decisions were the reason for Spurs’ victory. Nor did the manager blame the official for the yellow card shown two minutes from full-time to Alex Tettey, who will miss this weekend’s trip to Aston Villa, a match in which Norwich can ill-afford to drop points. “That was crazy,” said Neil of his midfielder’s foul.

It is the story that keeps on giving and to think the Hollywood screenwriter who plans to make a film about Jamie Vardy was in the stands to watch the latest chapter in this remarkable tale unfold. Roy Hodgson was also among the crowd and unable to suppress a smile as Vardy scored twice – the first a contender for goal of the season – on a night when Leicester looked like authentic title contenders in every sense. Vardy was magnificent and this was some way to celebrate the new three-and-a-half-year contract he will sign this week. He has now struck 18 Premier League goals this season and will probably never score a better one than the outrageous 25-yard volley that left Simon Mignolet clutching at thin air on the hour mark. It was a breathtaking moment of improvised brilliance and a strike Adrian Butchart, who was behind the Goal! movies and looking on from Vardy’s executive box, will do well to recreate. Vardy, however, was not finished and added a second from six yards out, in the 72nd minute, to put the game beyond Liverpool and maintain Leicester’s three-point lead at the top of the table before Saturday’s pivotal game at Manchester City. “England’s No9” and “We’re gonna’ win the league” chanted Leicester’s jubilant supporters at the end. On this evidence, it is hard to disagree with either notion. Leicester were superb and played with incredible intensity throughout, Claudio Ranieri’s players chasing every ball as if their lives depended on it. Yet they also produced some moments of genuine class, including a wonderful passage of one-touch football prior to Vardy’s second goal that would not have looked out of place at Camp Nou and ended with Shinji Okazaki going down in the area and appealing in vain for a penalty. It was certainly some start to a trio of matches that many believe will define Leicester’s season and determine whether they really can go on and do the unthinkable – win the league. After their trip to the Etihad Stadium, Leicester travel to Arsenal the following Sunday and if they can come through those two fixtures still enjoying the view from the top, Leicester supporters can really start to dream. This turned into a chastening experience for Liverpool. Jürgen Klopp prides himself on creating teams that press aggressively and cover every blade of grass, but the Liverpool manager was beaten at his own game here as Leicester worked tirelessly to close down their opponents, pinch possession and break with alacrity. “We didn’t give the Liverpool players time to think,” Ranieri said. Fast and furious, the game was played at a breathless pace at times, in particular in the opening half hour, and the only surprise was that it took so long for the first goal to arrive. Mignolet had something to do with that, the Liverpool goalkeeper producing two outstanding first-half saves, pushing Okazaki’s point-blank header on to the bar, from Vardy’s exquisite cross, and then tipping Riyad Mahrez’s sumptuous curling shot over later in the first half. Liverpool had their moments in the opening 45 minutes and got into some promising positions but lacked conviction when it mattered most. Mamadou Sakho and Roberto Firmino were playing a game of head-tennis in the Leicester area at one stage when either man could have gone for goal and Alberto Moreno should have done better with a wild left-footed shot shortly before half-time. Early in the second half Emre Can had a low 10-yard effort deflected wide after one of Liverpool’s best moves of the game. Klopp’s team were beginning to take control at the start of the second half and Leicester, for the first time, looked a little ragged, but Vardy’s bolt from the blue changed everything. Mahrez, who is looking more and more like his old self after a dip in form over the festive period, deserves more than a passing mention for the vision and technique he showed to pick out Vardy’s run with a lofted pass from deep in the Leicester half. It was the sort of ball that Vardy relishes yet this was no ordinary sprint into the channel. Sakho seemed to be pointing to Dejan Lovren to try and get across and put some pressure on Vardy as he stretched his legs but the England striker had his mind on only one thing and after letting the ball bounce thumped an audacious volley that flew into the near top corner. Liverpool never recovered from that blow and conceded a second 11 minutes later. The industrious Okazaki tried his luck with a shot that deflected into the path of Vardy and the 29-year-old finished clinically, lifting a left-footed shot beyond Mignolet and into the far corner. Little wonder Hodgson looked so happy.

He may be a long-standing Unicef goodwill ambassador who has been to the Philippines to see for himself the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan, but David Beckham’s most recent charitable act occurred closer to home. The London Ambulance Service has revealed that the former Manchester United and England footballer treated a paramedic and an elderly man to tea and coffee on Monday. Catherine Maynard, who works with the Cycle Response Unit, was helping the man who had fallen down, when she spotted Beckham near Endsleigh street in central London. “I was waiting with my patient for an ambulance to transfer him to hospital and although I was keeping him warm it was very cold outside,” she said. “All of a sudden, I looked up and saw someone who looked like David Beckham walking past us. He said hello and got in his car. I said to the man I was treating, ‘I think that was David Beckham’. Ten minutes later, he came back with a cup of coffee for me and a tea for the patient. “We were both very amused, and flattered. It was awful cycling around in the cold today and I couldn’t believe it when he came back with some hot drinks – I was so chuffed.” Beckham posed for a photo which was tweeted by the London Ambulance Service. The brush with celebrity was in stark contrast to a nasty incident experienced by Maynard this time last year when she and her crewmate were assaulted by two patients within two days. Beckham, 40, has been a Unicef goodwill ambassador since 2005. In February 2014, Beckham toured Tacloban and the surrounding areas, which had been devastated by Typhoon Haiyan. The visit clearly affected the former footballer. Last September, at a UN meeting in New York, Beckham fought back tears as he told the story of a young girl who died during the typhoon. The Beckham family is rarely out of the news. Last week, photographers expressed their frustration at Burberry’s decision to invite Brooklyn Beckham to shoot its latest fragrance campaign, saying it devalues the skills and training of professionals. The 16-year-old had announced on his Instagram feed that he would photograph the Burberry campaign at the weekend and that live updates would be posted on social media. Brooklyn is the second Beckham child to work with Burberry after his younger brother Romeo’s role in the label’s Christmas advert, which attracted 11m views within 48 hours of launching.

Let’s start with a statistic, because it is a pretty eye-catching one. Across his four transfer windows at Tottenham Hotspur, Mauricio Pochettino is £6.3m in credit on permanent fees spent. Daniel Levy, the chairman, is loving Pochettino right now because of how the manager has the club on course for the Champions League and, who knows, possibly the Premier League title, too, and to have done it on a shoestring makes his work even more admirable. More than anything, Pochettino has fired a feelgood factor, having shaped a vibrant, hungry young team that can go toe to toe with any other in England. As the ludicrously overblown pre-match montage at White Hart Lane reminds us, the game is about the glory and Pochettino has allowed Tottenham’s fans to dream, which, ultimately, is one of the best things about following a club. On Monday, as the clock ticked down towards the transfer deadline, Pochettino effectively made a demand of those supporters. He asked them, once again, to trust him. With everything that they have. The calls for him to sign an out-and-out striker in support of Harry Kane were almost hysterical last summer but there was nobody available who he liked enough and, crucially, would fit into his playing style. And so he rolled the dice. There is a little joke in the White Hart Lane press room before matches when the lineups are handed out: “Harry gets the nod up front.” Kane, of course, is the only established, senior option. Everybody connected to the club held their breath over the first half of the season and, happily, Kane stayed the course and he delivered. The 22-year-old has lacerated any fears that he might somehow have been a one-season wonder, after his breakthrough last time out. Pochettino, though, rolled the dice even harder on Monday because, unlike on 1 September, the fans can now sense the glory. It is within their grasp and, frankly, a top-four finish is theirs to throw away. With the increased expectation comes the greater fear of failure and it has crystallised around Kane who, more than ever, carries their hopes on his shoulders. It is a fair bet that Twitter would break if Kane were to suffer a serious injury and Tottenham missed out on the Champions League. Could you imagine? Pochettino said before last summer’s transfer deadline that he wanted proper cover for Kane and he used a line that got a smile. “It’s like when you are in love with a lady – there are a lot of women around the world but you want only one,” he said. At the time, he wanted Saido Berahino from West Bromwich Albion but Levy could not agree the deal. On 3 December, Pochettino again said that the club were tracking strikers before the winter window and he also accepted that none of his back-up options – Son Heung-min, Nacer Chadli and Clinton Njie – were specialists in the position. Njie has since been ruled out until April with a knee injury that required surgery. But Pochettino, to draw on the famous old Ian Holloway analogy, has never been about to bundle any old thing into the back of a taxi when the night is done. He is not a desperate guy, even with his mates egging him on. Levy was very keen for him to sign a striker at the last moment in the summer – he said that he could get Charlie Austin, who was then at Queens Park Rangers, only for Pochettino to say “No” – and, once again in January, it was Levy who was eager to do the business. Tottenham have scouted loads of strikers, including Jonathan Calleri, the 22-year-old Argentinian, who is now at São Paulo. The club were among those to watch Oumar Niasse extensively over the first half of the season – the Senegalese joined Everton for £13.5m on deadline day – while there was no chance of them, or indeed anyone, getting Berahino during this past window. There was also Fulham’s Moussa Dembélé, the 19-year-old Frenchman, who passed a medical with them on Saturday, with a view to a £6m transfer with a loan-back to Craven Cottage for the remainder of the season. With the consent of the player and the framework of the deal in place, Tottenham then moved to scrap the loan-back bit, which had always been set in stone from Fulham’s side. It was a liberty, Fulham felt, and they called everything off. Dembélé was the one that Pochettino wanted but he has lost no sleep over him or the fact that Kane’s burden feels as though it has just got heavier. Kane, lest anyone forget, is prized for his durability and stamina. Yes, Pochettino would have liked somebody else up front but not just anybody and the chemistry within the dressing-room that he has concocted remains of overriding importance. Nothing or nobody can come in from the outside to upset that. If it is a thing of great delicacy, then there are plenty of people who would argue that there is a tipping point between Son and Chadli being able to do a job up front and doing it brilliantly. Pochettino can counter by saying that the role of the No9 has changed, modern attacking tactics are much more fluid and he would back himself to find the collective solution, involving Son and/or Chadli, if the worst came to the worst and Kane were injured. If any manager has credit in the bank and the right to expect a bit of faith to be shown in him, it is surely Pochettino.

When it was all finished, with Steven Gerrard ruminating on a mistake that threatens to stick to his conscience like superglue, Brendan Rodgers could not disguise his disdain. "There were probably two buses parked today instead of one," he said. Chelsea, he said, had been time-wasting from the first minute, defending with 10 players on the 18-yard line. Liverpool's manager smiled and stabbed. It was not difficult to coach a team to be that negative, he added. No doubt there will be plenty who share his dislike of the way Chelsea set about to smother this game. Their tactics were cynical, calculated and often maddening. They were also, ultimately, spot on and that really was the bottom line after Liverpool's inability to get past those two buses had blown a gaping hole in their title chances. The handbrake was on, the keys had been chucked into the nearest drain and, for the first time in a long time, Anfield watched in something close to silence. Mourinho will not care if the opposition manager wallows in a vat of sour grapes. Call it anti-football, or whatever you like, but this match will not go into the record books with an asterisk to remind everyone that Chelsea did it the ugly way. It may, however, be remembered as the defining moment of Liverpool's season and a personal ordeal for Gerrard bearing in mind the potential consequences. Of all the people, in all the places, nobody could have imagined it would be Gerrard, in front of the Kop, making the mistake that changed everything. Rodgers immediately sought to absolve Gerrard, reminding his players at half-time this was someone who had "picked up this club so many times", and it would need a flint heart not to try to imagine the scale of the player's trauma. Yet this is a hard business and teams that want to win the league cannot be as generous as Gerrard was when Mamadou Sakho's pass rolled under the foot of Liverpool's captain and Demba Ba was suddenly running clear to score. Glen Johnson could be seen in the second half trying to cajole his team-mate but Gerrard played the rest of the match as if he was struggling to shake it out of his system. He knew the ramifications and Liverpool's efforts to retrieve the damage carried none of the elegance and vigour that have been the hallmark of their season. Gerrard, if anything, was too desperate to make amends, rushing his work and trying long-range shots when a simple pass would have been more effective. Chelsea defended with structure, brilliance and the kind of togetherness that seems to come almost naturally to Mourinho's teams on the big occasions. He talked about it afterwards as the immaculate defensive performance – "no mistakes, the best team won" – and it culminated with Liverpool putting so much into trying to find an equaliser that they left themselves vulnerable to that moment, right at the end, when Fernando Torres and Willian broke on the counterattack. The two substitutes had nothing between them and Simon Mignolet but open air. Torres set up Willian and Mourinho was on one of his victory runs, beating his chest, letting out all the pent-up emotion. Rodgers had his say afterwards but, lest it be forgotten, this was a Chelsea side put together with the second leg of their Champions League semi-final against Atlético Madrid in mind. Mark Schwarzer, Branislav Ivanovic and César Azpilicueta will start on Wednesday and Ashley Cole has a fair-to-middling chance. That apart, Mourinho had brought in his support cast, including a 20-year-old centre-half by the name of Tomas Kalas for his Premier League debut. Kalas's previous Chelsea career had consisted of two appearances as an 89th-minute substitute in cup competitions and he recently joked that his role at the club was to be a training-ground cone. Yet he demonstrated here why he has already won a cap for the Czech Republic. "Beautiful," Mourinho said afterwards. "Beautiful … this kid, Liverpool, Anfield, just beautiful." Luis Suárez chose a bad day to have one of his more undistinguished performances but a lot of that was to do with the expertise that Kalas and Ivanovic showed. Azpilicueta and Cole matched them and Schwarzer, at the age of 41, showed there is not a lot that fazes him. "They had 10 behind the ball from the first minute," Rodgers said. He had better get used to it. Mourinho's team gave everything to make sure they could not be added to the list of visitors to Anfield who had been blitzed. Time-wasters? Undoubtedly. They tied their shoelaces. They had collective, and convenient, cramp. They pretended they could not hear the whistle and when they had a throw-in or free-kick nobody was ever in a rush to take it. It was calculated, and often unsatisfactory, and when the ball came to Mourinho there was a telling scene as Gerrard and Jon Flanagan tried to wrestle it off him. Chelsea's manager spun it behind his back and tossed it out of their reach. That was six minutes in. What an irony that it was in the added-on time at the end of the first half – and the referee, Martin Atkinson, really should have included more – that Chelsea took the lead. Liverpool had no choice but to take more risks in the second half but they lacked their usual creativity and dynamism. Willian slipped the ball into an empty net and Liverpool, from a position of command, must fear all that brilliant momentum has gone. Man of the match Tomas Kalas (Chelsea)

1) Rogério Ceni Whenever a goalkeeper scores a goal, there are probably people who think that they have committed a crime against nature and who believe that such heretical behaviour will bring forth a storm of biblical proportions as punishment, washing the illogicality away. Yet by the same token, there is something inherently glorious about a goalkeeper who refuses to be constrained by the “rules” of “society”, which is why Stuart Pearce’s brainwave to have Manchester City’s David James galumphing about in Middlesbrough’s area on the final day of the 2004-05 season is a Hall of Fame moment. Weirdly unsettling but also totally adorable, like watching a cat trying to turn a door handle. Ha! Look at the keeper go! He thinks he’s people! He thinks he has opposable thumbs! But these are life’s dreamers. Like David Brent refusing to give up on the idea that he was wasted as the manager of a small paper company in Slough, there are goalkeepers who are convinced they are wasted simply operating between the sticks. Fabien Barthez, for instance, was a chilled-out entertainer with delusions of grandeur and it could be argued that no one knows the smell of the onion bag better than a goalkeeper. To catch a thief, you must think like a thief, so to score a goal, you must first let in a goal. Admittedly that’s a stupid argument, but when has that ever stopped the Joy of Six in the past? Yet while most goalkeepers are kidding themselves, some of these frustrated strikers actually do have something to offer going forward. Of course, leave it to a Brazilian to set the benchmark for his peers. If an English goalkeeper ever scored 112 goals in his career, the likelihood is it would be down to the wind catching 112 agricultural hoofs forward and sending them swirling over his opposite number, but that’s not Rogério Ceni’s style. Ceni, who plays for São Paulo, is that rarest and most cherished of species, a goalkeeper who also happens to be a free-kick and penalty specialist, and stands on top of the goalscoring charts, miles ahead of the rest of the field. His record is not perfect and he has missed penalties, most notably in the last minute of a match against Corinthians last year, but he has also scored a Panenka against the same opponents. It is not clear whether Ceni had his membership of the Goalkeepers’ Union revoked after that. Having honed his technique, Ceni is as big a threat with a dead ball as any outfield player – Zico once said, perhaps not entirely seriously, that he was better than him at free-kicks – and the joyous scenes when he scored his 100th career goal with a glorious effort from 25 yards were a sight to behold. Now 41, Ceni plans to bring a remarkable career to a close at the end of the season. No doubt he has something big planned for his final game. 2) José Luis Chilavert Of course, Ceni is not the only goalscoring goalkeeper. He’s just the best goalscoring goalkeeper. But there are others, such as Mexico’s fashion-conscious Jorge Campos, who scored 38 goals, and René Higuita, who scored 41 goals. Until Ceni, though, Paraguay’s legendary goalkeeper, José Luis Chilavert, was the daddy of the lot. He first came to attention in England during the 1998 World Cup, when he became the first goalkeeper ever to shoot direct at goal from a free-kick in the tournament, narrowly missing against Bulgaria. He could be a fiery character and was involved in rows with Roberto Carlos, claiming he only spat at the Brazil left-back to defend himself after being insulted, and Faustino Asprilla, but he also had a humble streak, often shaking hands with the goalkeepers he had scored against. And he was brilliant. A fine shot-stopper, he won personal awards for his goalkeeping and played for Paraguay 74 times and at two World Cups. He scored eight goals for his country, which is more than any other international goalkeeper, and his free-kicks were outstanding. That left foot knew how to manipulate a football. Some people, those who have put the bald statistics to one side, say that Chilavert was better than Ceni. They have a point when you consider that Chilavert scored intentionally with a free-kick from the halfway line for Vélez against River Plate in 1996, a goal so good that the cameraman almost missed it and the River goalkeeper was so dumbfounded he simply fell over backwards as the ball flies in. Chilavert celebrated appropriately, both arms outstretched, a look of glee on his face, an amusingly slow jog to nowhere in particularly and, finally, a botched Klinsmann dive that ends up as a belly flop. 3) Charlie Williams It was not until 1912 that the law was modified to say that goalkeepers could only handle the ball inside their area. Previously they had been allowed to pick it up anywhere inside their own half – honestly, one rule for them, another for the rest of us – which is why it was possible for two goalkeepers to score in a match between Third Lanark and Motherwell in 1910. The first recorded instance of a goalkeeper scoring in England came on 14 April 1900, when Manchester City’s Charlie Williams scored in a 3-1 defeat by Sunderland. Although there appears to be no coverage available of the match from the time, the following report in the Times on 17 October 1958 did refer to it: “One of the most remarkable goals ever scored in first-class football came in the fourth minute of the match at Grimsby when Dolejsi, the Prague international goalkeeper, scored direct from his own penalty-box. A short goal-kick to a full-back was returned to him, and Dolejsi kicked the ball hard upfield. Aided by a strong wind it soared high, bounced once on the edge of the Grimsby penalty box, over the head of the advancing Grimsby goalkeeper and into the net without any other player having touched it. The only previous instance of a goalkeeper scoring in this country was in 1900 [Joy of Six Corrections and Clarifications Department: this is actually the first recorded instance of it happening. Goalkeepers had scored in England between 1900 and 1958], when Charles Williams, Manchester City’s goalkeeper, scored against Sunderland with a prodigious goal-kick. Ned Doig, Sunderland’s Scottish international goalkeeper of that era, was the only other player to touch the ball.” It is said that Williams’s kick bounced three times before going in and that Doig, who always wore a cap to hide his baldness, later said that the only reason it caught him out is because he was examining a damaged finger. A likely story. 4) Peter Schmeichel “And … wait … yes … yes ... it appears the goalkeeper is going forward ... they’re beckoning him forward … or are they telling him to stay back … no, they’re telling him to go forward for the corner! They’re sending the goalkeeper forward!“ The above, without fail, is the words that fall out of every commentator’s mouth when a goalkeeper ventures forward at a corner to try to salvage an equaliser for his side. Usually such a fevered buildup leads to nothing, the delivery going nowhere near the goalkeeper, whose presence alone is supposed to unsettle the defending team, who we are supposed to assume will be completely unprepared for such an eventuality. The goalkeeper is not necessarily there to score – sometimes he just meant to cause havoc and spread panic. Two goalkeepers in the same area! Which one is which! Which one is ours! What’s that round thing coming towards me! Why is everyone shouting! Run! Run for your lives! But it can work and it is exciting when it does. Peter Schmeichel, who scored 13 goals in his career, first found the net for Manchester United with a last-minute header in their Uefa Cup exit to Rotor Volgograd in 1995. “Schmeichel came out of his goal and the final minutes were played out with him using his huge bulk in the Russian area,” wrote Guy Hodgson in the Independent and the Dane also scored a volley for Aston Villa at Everton in 2001. His finest goal was one that didn’t count, though, an overhead kick that looked to have taken United’s FA Cup fourth-round replay against Wimbledon at Selhurst Park into extra time, only for the flag to go up for offside. 5) Brad Friedel By now, you are probably wondering when this is going to end. And also where the Jimmy Glass entry is. Well, there is no Jimmy Glass entry, because the loanee who scored the injury-time goal that kept Carlisle in the Football League in 1999 has had his own Joy of Six spot two years ago. “There’s nothing new to say about Jimmy Glass,” Rob Smyth wrote. “Glass’s goal is one of the great moments in British football, and his name is almost as evocative as that of Ronnie Radford.” So this will have to do but what Glass’s earth-shattering escape act tells us is that it is difficult to beat the drama of a goalkeeper scoring a goal in the last minute, not least because it tends to be the defining moment of a match. Or sometimes a career. Not always, though. At first glance, there is nothing particularly memorable about Brad Friedel’s last-minute equaliser for Blackburn Rovers in a nondescript Premier League match against Charlton Athletic in 2004. Admittedly Blackburn, who were struggling near the bottom of the table, had roared back from 2-0 down to level the match at 2-2 at The Valley, so it looked like Friedel had secured a vital point for his team by redirecting a wayward shot past Dean Kiely from close range. And that should have been that. Charlton, the inept fools, had thrown the game away and Brad of the Rovers was the hero. All that was left now was to see whether Blackburn could score again in the time left. But wait! Barely a minute later, the ball was hoofed forwards by Charlton after the restart and when it dropped to Claus Jensen on the edge of the area, he looped a volley towards the top-right corner and Friedel, presumably still giddy and not entirely focused after his goal, got a hand to the shot but not enough to keep it out. Oh Brad! “I find it hard to speak,” Blackburn’s manager, Graeme Souness, said, an affliction that he fortunately rid himself of before becoming a pundit. 6) Laurent Monde Anyone who has ever played football in the park or on the playground has experienced that creeping sense of dread when your goalkeeper, the ball in his hands, gets that glint in his eye. You know the one: it’s supposed to warn you that he has short-circuited and that you have to stop him before he sets off on a jaunty, doomed dribble that is supposed to be a tribute to Diego Maradona but will end with him losing the ball and the other side’s striker booting it into the empty net while you curse yourself for not acting sooner. All of which is why no good can come from Laurent Monde’s absurd goal for Kouroucien in French Guyana. It will only encourage disastrous imitations and no one can possibly emulate Monde’s moment of genius. Unfortunately the grainy video only starts with him picking up possession on the right in his half so we do not know how the move began, but what happens next is truly ridiculous, Monde hurtling through the challenges and up the wing like a contestant on Gladiators blindly charging through The Gauntlet head-first and somehow managing to keep the ball despite always appearing to be on the verge of falling over, as if he is stumbling through a series of invisible hurdles. Presumably everyone was too scared to tackle him, mindful of the fact that you got an automatic red card if you even breathed near the opposition keeper on Fifa 98: Road to the World Cup. Eventually Monde blooters a thunderous shot home from way out on the right, before being mobbed by his team-mates, who probably spent the entire sequence calling him every name under the sun until he scored. Confusion arises as the only name that it is possible to make out on the commentary is Stanley Menzo, a Dutch goalkeeper who starred for Ajax between 1983 and 1994. The likeliest explanation for this is that Menzo was regarded as a goalkeeper before his time because he was so comfortable with the ball at his feet. As for the rest of you, though, don’t go getting any ideas.

This was a match lit up by players in Chelsea blue yet by the end José Mourinho's thoughts were mainly occupied by the member of his squad who, after the final whistle, strode through Stamford Bridge's press room in casual dress. Samuel Eto'o was beaming, no doubt delighted by his team-mates' win against Stoke, and there was also a spring in his step, providing Mourinho with hope that the forward will be out of his jeans and back in contention when Paris Saint-Germain arrive on Tuesday. Eto'o has not featured for Chelsea since injuring a hamstring in their 6-0 victory over Arsenal last month and, as is often the case, his importance to the team has grown with each day he has not been able to actually play for them. Largely this is because the man who has featured instead, Fernando Torres, has been, well – Fernando Torres. In two starts, against Crystal Palace on 29 March and then again on Saturday, the Spaniard performed with a level of impotence that has come to define his time in west London. In between, Torres was left out of the Chelsea starting lineup that lost 3-1 to PSG in their Champions League quarter-final first leg, with his ineffective arrival as a substitute leading to Mourinho witheringly commenting after the contest about how he lacked "real strikers". In fairness to the Portuguese, he gave Torres another chance to shine but, yet again, the 30-year-old did not seize the opportunity against Stoke City. Little wonder, then, that Mourinho is keen for Eto'o to return for the second leg, with the Cameroonian likely to be given the nod should he get through Monday's pre-match training session. "If we don't score a minimum of two goals, we are out. We know that," said Mourinho. "If we can have everybody available who can give us a chance to score goals then let's do that. So maybe I will pick him [Eto'o] but to risk a player you need to have minimum conditions. If you think he's going to be out after 10 minutes of the game you can't take that risk. But if there is a minimum of conditions of risk, then, yes, I will pick him." Mourinho has made little secret of his dissatisfaction with his three principal strikers – Eto'o, Torres and Demba Ba – and, quite simply, the former represents the best of a bad bunch. Since arriving from Anzhi Makhachkala in August, the 33-year-old has scored 11 times in 31 appearances for Chelsea, compared with nine in 34 for Torres and five in 22 for Ba this season. Crucially, as far as PSG are concerned, all of Eto'o's goals have come at Stamford Bridge and the hope for Chelsea is that he will be fit enough to score at least twice more on home soil on Tuesday. Such expectations certainly cannot be placed on Torres. Without a goal in his last seven games, looks a shell of his former, feared self. There was plenty of industry but very little threat and by the closing stages it appeared as if he was intentionally not shooting in fear of missing. In total, Torres had only three attempts on goal, two of which were off target. He also lost possession on 10 occasions. With Torres struggling, it was left to those around him to seal the victory. The hosts performed with thrust and purpose from the start and it appeared only a matter of time before they scored. The breakthrough came in the 32nd minute when Mohamed Salah secured his second goal for Chelsea on his first Premier League start before the excellent Willian wrapped up the win with a curled finish 18 minutes from time. In between Frank Lampard converted a penalty to seal his 250th career goal. All eyes are now on PSG, who strengthened their position at the top of Ligue 1 with a 3-0 win over Reims on Saturday in which the manager, Laurent Blanc, rested a host of first-team players. Lampard, for one, is confident Chelsea can repeat their feat of 2012, when they overcame a 3-1 first-leg deficit against Napoli to progress to the Champions League quarter-finals. "You're looking at a stronger team [than Napoli] but we can certainly win by two goals," said the midfielder. "It's about being focused and getting our attitude and pace in our game right." For Stoke, the aim remains to achieve a host of club targets, most notably a first Premier League top-half finish. To make certain of that Mark Hughes's side will have to improve on this display, with the visitors organised but utterly blunt in attack, summed up by their best chance when, late on, Marko Arnautovic found space in the Chelsea area but made a hash of controlling Steven Nzonzi's long pass. "This is a wake-up call for us," said Hughes. "We've got five games left and now need to refocus and understand what's required at this level." Man of the match Willian (Chelsea)

Brendan Rodgers was in Melbourne when news arrived of the most insulting pound thrown at Liverpool by Arsenal since Jamie Carragher was struck by a coin at Highbury in 2002. Preparing for a pre-season friendly before 95,000 fans at the MCG, the Liverpool manager was shown confirmation of Arsenal's latest offer for Luis Suárez by the managing director Ian Ayre: £40,000,001. "We looked at it and laughed," recalls Rodgers. Liverpool can afford to smile now. Third in the table, two points behind the league leaders and with their manager predicting a sustained challenge for Champions League qualification for the first time since 2009-10, Liverpool's hardline stance on Suárez is gaining merit by the week. Last weekend the Uruguay international scored a hat-trick, taking his tally to six goals in four games, as Rodgers' team turned in their finest overall display of the campaign so far against West Bromwich Albion. On Saturday Liverpool can underline those Champions League credentials, and suggest perhaps even more, at Arsenal's expense at the Emirates Stadium. That cheeky pound can take some of the credit if they do. A brief moment of brevity in Australia apart, Liverpool were deeply offended by the bid that Arsenal believed would trigger a £40m-plus release clause in Suárez's contract. Almost four months on it still seems extraordinary that a club of Arsenal's stature, a player of Suárez's ambition and an agent of Pere Guardiola's experience could misinterpret such a key clause. As Liverpool's principal owner John W Henry tweeted at the time: "What do you think they're smoking over there at Emirates?" Henry and Rodgers had resolved not to strengthen a Premier League team's top four prospects at Liverpool's expense by selling Suárez, though Arsenal continued dialogue in the two weeks between their initial £35m offer and the £40,000,001 nail in that transfer coffin. Bitter recrimination followed, not only between the two clubs but Suárez and Liverpool, with the striker accusing his manager of breaking a promise over his future and being ordered to train away from the first-team squad until his attitude improved. It is clear, despite Rodgers' insistence on Thursday that the episode will not add spice to Saturday's fixture, that some resentment lingers. The Liverpool manager said: "I think Arsenal were ill advised on that bid, to say the least. Arsenal as a football club always had great integrity historically and so, when that bid came through, I can only say it was one of the worst pieces of information they ever received, from whoever it was. It was never going to succeed but of course you do have to chance your arm. At the time we certainly saw the bid as derogatory. The two clubs have historically had class, it has been the hallmark of both clubs, but whether it was £40m and one pound or £40m and one pence our fight was always to keep him here because he is a top player." Arsène Wenger, on the other hand, admits the bid was "not the most subtle thing we have done but it was not meant to be provocative at all". The Arsenal manager added: "It could be interpreted like that but it was not our purpose. It was one of the transfers that did not work and, in every club, you have two or three but there is no need afterwards to speak about it." Derogatory it might have been for a player of Suárez's quality, albeit a player whose baggage ensured Arsenal were the only club to make an official offer to Liverpool this summer, but the Premier League has been enriched by the £40,000,001 bid. Liverpool kept one world-class star and Arsenal signed a £42.5m alternative in Mesut Özil, reversing the talent drain to Spain and ending the fractious moralising over Suárez among their fanbase. Both clubs have moved on swiftly, the competition at the Premier League summit has increased and in Liverpool's case it is Suárez who merits a large share of credit. Liverpool's progress this season commenced before the 26-year-old returned from suspension but, where others would have responded to the club's stance with disruption, Suárez has offered unquestionable commitment and class alongside Daniel Sturridge. Liverpool are a stronger club and team for, like Carragher 11 years ago, throwing the pound back in Arsenal's direction. Reflecting on the summer, Rodgers said: "As a manager the job is obviously about managing individuals but you have got to protect the club. I'm sure the senior players, indeed all the players, are looking to the manager in a situation like that to see what happens. It cannot fester and be allowed to become a cancer within the group. "No matter how difficult the situation was, we were leading up to our first game of the season having had a brilliant pre-season and nothing could be allowed to stand in the way of our preparation for that. As we said at the time, no one was going to be bigger than the club and we had the opportunity to show that we are a big club. The status and the power of Liverpool is greater than anyone. "But you have to give Luis huge credit as well. Probably many players would not have reacted as he has done. He eventually accepted the situation, got back to his work, rejoined his team-mates and has been outstanding in his work ethic and desire since then. He missed those first five league games but is up near the top of the goalscoring chart already. For me, I see an improvement in his game and a maturity in his overall personality." While Rodgers can proclaim Suárez and Sturridge as the best strike partnership in the Premier League, Wenger remains heavily reliant on one striker, Olivier Giroud, to sustain Arsenal's challenge until the transfer window reopens in January. The Liverpool manager could not resist one final dig on that score. "It may become difficult if you lose that one striker," said Rodgers. "I'd think Arsène Wenger will look to get a striker in [in January] and will be hoping and praying that he doesn't get any injuries. And he's obviously got … Nicklas Bendtner."

Steve McClaren branded Newcastle United’s performance at Goodison Park “unacceptable” as the biggest spenders in the January transfer window remained embedded in the relegation zone following a 3-0 defeat by Everton. Aaron Lennon’s first-half strike and two late penalties from Ross Barkley, who sealed his 100th league appearance for his boyhood club with a “Panenka” past the visiting goalkeeper, Rob Elliot, gave Roberto Martínez’s team their first home win since November in comfortable style. Newcastle were weak in defence and in attack, and stay third from bottom of the Premier League having scored only six away goals all season. McClaren started with two £12m signings in Andros Townsend and Jonjo Shelvey, and fellow January recruit Henri Saivet, and had the new loan arrival Seydou Doumbia on the bench. But he was left demanding a reaction against West Bromwich Albion at St James’ Park on Saturday following a spiritless display. “We have said you can’t waste a game now and that’s what we’ve done,” said a clearly seething Newcastle manager. “We felt we could come here and get a result but we had to come here and perform at our level and there were a lot of players below that level and that is why we lost. Some of them know they have fallen short. That is not what we have come to expect and you can’t afford to do that with games ebbing away. “A few players did not play at the level and didn’t show their quality which is why we lost. In terms of injuries and performance that is not our level of performance which we have been producing.” McClaren denied Newcastle’s attitude contributed to their collective failure at Goodison. But he said: “The attitude has been a different class the last couple of months. We had bad results against Leicester and Crystal Palace [in November] where that [attitude] was questioned but since then it has been excellent. I felt it was disappointing we returned to that level and that is unacceptable.” Newcastle will be without the suspended Jamaal Lascelles against Albion after the defender was dismissed for denying Barkley a clear goalscoring opportunity in stoppage time. McClaren also lost the defenders Chancel Mbemba and Paul Dummett to injury. “In terms of things that can go wrong, they did go wrong, especially in terms of injuries,” said McClaren. “We have to dust ourselves down, we have 52,000 people who will turn up at the weekend and demand that, and we have to give them something now against West Brom.” For Martínez there was the rare sight of Everton turning superiority into three points on home soil with his team winning in the league at Goodison for only the fourth time this season. The Everton manager, celebrating his 100th league game in charge, said Barkley’s impressive contribution was evidence the England international is maturing into a leader for the team. “One hundred games in the Premier League at 22 is a remarkable landmark,” Martínez said. “Last season Ross was a young man with enormous potential. Now he has shown he’s not a young man anymore. He is still young in terms of age, but not as a professional footballer. He is ready to lead the team, his decision-making has gone to a different level and he represents Everton in incredible style. Now he has a maturity, and he is a confident young man with an incredible technical ability. He’s been so consistent this season.” Barkley took the two late penalties because the regular taker, Romelu Lukaku, had been withdrawn at half-time with a back injury that is likely to keep the striker out of Saturday’s trip to Stoke City. Martínez said: “We gave all the players three penalties in training yesterday and if they scored all three then we said they could be back-up to Rom in the games, Ross did, so we said he could in the game.But he didn’t take a Panenka [in training] – he wasn’t allowed!”The Everton manager confirmed John Stones was omitted due to a “niggle” in his hamstring and is expected to be rested for a week to 10 days.

Gary Neville insisted that he had no intention of resigning as Valencia manager after his side was hammered 7-0 at the Camp Nou by Barcelona on Wednesday night – but the club’s sporting director Suso García Pitarch described it as “one of the worst results in our history” and evaded questions about the Englishman’s future at the Mestalla. Valencia are not expected to take a drastic decision. Neville was asked three times if he was thinking of resigning after four goals from Luis Suárez and three from Lionel Messi saw his side fall to a semi-final first leg defeat in the Copa del Rey. He gave a one-word response to the first question, replying simply: “no.” When the issue was raised again, with Neville asked if he would understand it if he was sacked, he responded: “next question”. The third time, he replied: “Next question. I have answered that before. I think I was very clear. “This was one of my most painful nights in football,” the former Manchester United full-back revealed after Valencia were effectively knocked out of the Copa del Rey, even though there is a second leg to come at the Mestalla next Wednesday night. It was not just that his side was defeated; it was that Barcelona could have beaten them by more than seven. Even the first-half sending off of Shkodran Mustafi was no excuse. Valencia were humiliated. Neville admitted that had he been a pundit analysing his team’s performance he would have been “critical”, adding: “The scoreline is unacceptable. I have not enjoyed tonight. I won’t sleep well tonight. I didn’t like what I saw. “The fans didn’t deserve that tonight. We have to recover incredibly quickly”. But he insisted that he would not throw in the towel, despite a difficult start to his managerial career. “Positivity has been immovable in my life,” he said. “I last had doubts as a player 18 years ago and from that moment on I developed a mechanism to deal with situations like this. Be clear, we have to deliver on Sunday [against Real Betis].” Valencia have not won in Neville’s eight league games, and in their last 11 in total – and last weekend they lost 1-0 to Sporting Gijón at the Mestalla, the first time they had been beaten at home in the league since November 2014. The Copa del Rey had come as a welcome distraction – until Wednesday night. Valencia had won four times under Neville in the competition, his only wins as manager in 15 games: against Second Division B side Barrakaldo, twice against Granada and then away at Las Palmas. Defeat only increases the pressure, even though the supporters’ anger has so far been directed more at the players and the boardroom than the manager. The club’s Singaporean owner, Peter Lim, was not at the Camp Nou but the president, Layhoon Chan, was watching from the directors’ box. García Pitarch revealed afterwards that they he had spoken to her following the game and pushed by TV channel Canal Plus to confirm Neville’s continuity at the club, he was evasive. “This isn’t a day to give any explanations and simply to recognise that we have done things very badly and we have to rectify it in any way we can,” García Pitarch said. “We apologise to our fans for one of the worst days and one of the worst results in our history. Asked again, he responded: “Simply, we have to reflect [on this] internally.” García Pitarch was then asked if he had spoken to Lim and whether the owner supported the manager. “I speak with [the director] Lay Hoon every day, I don’t normally speak with Peter Lim,” the sporting director replied. “We have had a meeting to see what our reflections were on the game. These are internal reflections [to be made] inside the club and there are many things to evaluate. Today is the worst day to try to give explanations. Our fans don’t deserve a result like this.” He added: “We know what we have to do. We know the situation the club is in is difficult. We have to reflect internally whilst recognising we have caused tremendous disappointment to our fans.”

Arsène Wenger was involved in a tunnel row with the Southampton manager Ronald Koeman after frustrations boiled over at the end of Tuesday night’s goalless draw at the Emirates. The Arsenal manager is reported to have confronted the referee, Lee Mason, and the fourth official, Craig Pawson, outside the dressing rooms to complain about several decisions Wenger claimed were missed as Arsenal lost ground in the title race. The Daily Mail reported the Frenchman complaining to Mason: “It’s always the same with you.” Koeman, however, saw the exchange and intervened, telling Wenger: “And it’s always the same with you. You had 10 chances to score and couldn’t take any of them so why have a go at them?” The 0-0 draw left Arsenal five points adrift of the Premier League leaders Leicester City, who beat Liverpool 2-0, and saw them drop a place to fourth, below Tottenham Hotspur, who won 3-0 at Norwich City.

Manuel Pellegrini’s extended farewell to Manchester City began on a winning note but he will surely enjoy easier evenings before making way for Pep Guardiola in the summer. Thanks to Sergio Agüero’s first-half winner City’s title challenge remains very much alive, but if Sunderland can keep playing with this sort of sheer bloody-minded determination, a team which merited at least a draw here will not deserve to be relegated. The verve and vibrancy of a quite formidable second-half attacking performance from Sam Allardyce’s players stretched Pellegrini’s side to the limit. With the home debutant Wahbi Khazri frequently fazing the Chilean’s defence, Jan Kirchhoff increasingly imperious in central midfield and Joe Hart performing heroics in the visiting goal, it was small wonder the home manager pronounced himself “gutted”. Pellegrini simply looked relieved. “It was very important to win here,” said a coach whose name was chorused by the visiting fans. “It was a very tough game and a very good result.” Inevitably he was asked about his impending departure. “I’m not thinking about that,” came the reply. “I’m just thinking about having a good season. We’re not thinking about the future; we’re living in the present.” Considering Sunderland are still second bottom Allardyce has reason to fear for the future. “I feel gutted,” he said. “It’s the most disappointed I’ve been since coming here. A point was the least we deserved. We created more chances than Manchester City but Joe Hart showed why he’s the England goalkeeper. Manchester City had one chance and Agüero scored. But I don’t know anybody who has played as well as Jan Kirchhoff in central midfield for anybody this season.” His revamped XI showcased a new look 4-1-4-1 formation featuring Kirchhoff, their new £750,000 central defensive signing from Bayern Munich – who had endured a shambolic debut at Tottenham last month – in the anchoring role behind midfield. It was a job he would become almost astonishingly good at. With Lamine Koné, making an impressive bow at centre half following a £5m move from Lorient, quickly endearing himself to his new public by unleashing a teasing cross from the right which Martin Demichelis was forced to hack clear, Sunderland began reasonably brightly. Even so, local optimism took quite a dent when Yaya Touré and Jesús Navas combined to create Agüero’s 12th goal in his last 10 Premier League appearances. If Agüero appeared every inch the expert marksman as he toe-poked Navas’s deflected left-wing cross into the roof of the net from close range, Billy Jones looked a thoroughly wrong-footed right back. Attempting to make amends, Jones launched into a challenge as the striker shot, his studs raking Agüero down the back of a leg and, following prolonged treatment, leaving him with a badly torn, blood stained, sock. Undeterred, he might have scored a second had his curling shot not taken a deflection off Yann M’Vila. Significantly that opening was conjured by 19-year-old Kelechi Iheanacho who showed precisely why he had been preferred to Raheem Sterling by holding off John O’Shea quite brilliantly before supplying Agüero. David Silva was starting to control the tempo of the game but Sunderland had their moments and, as Kirchhoff was proving, were far from incapable of disrupting the visitors’ rhythm. Koné should have equalised but made an absolute hash of an unmarked close range header following Jeremain Lens’s excellent free kick. Bar accidentally catching Demichelis in the mouth with a stray elbow Jermain Defoe had been fairly quiet, but all that changed when he turned his marker before dispatching a shot which was destined for the bottom corner until Hart dived low to divert the danger. Recovering rapidly, his positioning then prevented Jones from scoring on the rebound. Aware that, for all City’s elegant menace, Vito Mannone had had precious little to do, Allardyce perhaps sensed it might not take all that much to change the narrative. He duly introduced Khazri, his £9m signing from Bordeaux, at half time, the Tunisian replacing the injured Lens. With Pellegrini suspecting that, despite some dazzling footwork, Iheanacho might not be defensively streetwise enough to protect his side’s lead, he sent Fernando on in his stead to bolster central midfield. Sure enough Sunderland were suddenly rampant and Patrick van Aanholt was unfortunate to see an excellent left-wing cross fractionally evade Defoe. If the geometry of City’s short passing exuded class, key performers were tiring fast as the game became slightly spiky. Defoe and Nicolás Otamendi squared up in the wake of an aerial challenge, before a wince-inducing heavyweight collision involving Touré and Koné. Sunderland though retained sufficient focus for Jones to prompt another fantastic save from Hart. The keeper subsequently did extremely well to twice deny Khazri while Otamendi would clear Kirchhoff’s late header off the line, ensuring City continue to cling to Leicester’s coat-tails.

Salomón Rondón equalised in stoppage time to earn West Bromwich Albion what could turn out to be a crucial point, keeping Swansea City among the seven teams beneath them in the challenge to stay in the Premier League. But it was not enough to prevent boos smattering around The Hawthorns at the final whistle. Gylfi Sigurdsson’s fourth goal in five games midway through the second half looked to have earned Swansea a third successive victory as Francesco Guidolin, their new head coach, continues to make a good first impression in English football, before Rondón turned the ball over the line after Kyle Naughton appeared to handle Darren Fletcher’s shot. West Brom could eke out sufficient draws to keep their heads above water but their fans are not sure whether their glass is half-full or half-empty. When Tony Pulis was asked whether a run of one win in seven games concerned him, the Albion head coach responded it was also only one defeat in nine. Retaining Premier League status for a sixth successive season will be a creditable achievement but Albion fans are restless for more aesthetic appeal. Their team created more chances than of late, with Darren Fletcher having three clear heading opportunities in front of goal. But with Saido Berahino again restricted to a substitute’s appearance in the wake of Newcastle United’s rejected £21m bid, Rondón’s scrappy late equaliser saved West Brom from louder disapproval. The natives also made clear their dissatisfaction at Stéphane Sessègnon being withdrawn when Berahino was brought on. “You’re always going to get some boos,” Pulis said. “The crowd have been brilliant here. They have people they like and people they don’t, you have to accept that. I’m too long in the tooth not to accept a couple of jeers when you make a substitution.” Sigurdsson scored midway through the second half when West Brom, held at home by Peterborough United in Saturday’s FA Cup fourth round, were still readjusting their defensive personnel. The home fans had been chanting Berahino’s name intermittently throughout and there was a loud cheer when he stripped ready for duty. Unfortunately for those wanting a more attacking change it was Sessègnon who was withdrawn, to loud boos. This disenchantment intensified when Swansea took the lead within two minutes. The loss to a hamstring injury of Jonny Evans, a centre-back playing at left-back, had already disrupted Albion as Craig Dawson, a right-footed centre-back starting at right-back, switched to the other side of defence. So when Sigurdsson timed his run perfectly as the ball spun off Gareth McAuley’s tackle on Alberto Paloschi, the Icelandic playmaker had time to drill his shot into the far bottom corner. Paloschi, Swansea’s £8m signing, made his debut when coming on for Ki Sung-yeung, who suffered a minor concussion when clashing heads with Sessègnon, at the end of the first half. The Italian hit a post from Naughton’s cross just before Rondón converted at the death. Paloschi almost scored with his first touch, running on to Wayne Routledge’s clever ball, but Ben Foster, on his 200th league appearance, saved superbly. Unchanged from the victory at Everton 10 days ago and refreshed from their absence from the FA Cup, Swansea’s approach play was in the club’s finest traditions. The diminutive winger Routledge starting as a lone striker countered West Brom’s deployment of four centre-halves. Sigurdsson almost scored with a 35-yard volley that Foster had to back-pedal to push wide. Fletcher played at the front of West Brom’s midfield triangle and almost scored in the opening minute from Craig Dawson’s cross, only for Lukasz Fabianski to tip over. Fletcher later headed across goal towards Rondón, rather than going for goal himself, while Dawson should have done better than head wide when Sessègnon’s free-kick allowed him to dive in unmarked. Guidolin appreciates his side are making progress as relegation fears appear to ease. “I’m disappointed now but I’m optimistic because I watched my team play very well,” Swansea’s new head coach said. “We have lost two points but West Brom are a strong team. It’s difficult to win in this stadium. But I’m positive because my team has played well for 93 minutes.” Talks are planned between Berahino and Jeremy Peace after the West Brom chairman rejected approaches from Newcastle and Stoke City.

Click to enlarge, and debate the strip below the line. Keith Hackett's verdict 1) Equipment is tightly defined in the laws: items such as "undershorts or tights" are permitted, but additional equipment such as snoods or padded shorts are not. So ask the player to leave the pitch and get changed – he can return when the ball is next out of play, once you have checked he is wearing proper kit. Thanks to Joseph Cummins. 2) Regretably, his tactic might well be rewarded. You have no option but to dismiss the goalkeeper – and there is no requirement in the laws for you then to equalise the number of players involved: that only applies before the shoot-out begins. So the keeper's side can indeed now use their star striker to take the potentially decisive kick. It's clearly not a fair situation, and it's an anomaly that should be addressed. John Lennon wins the shirt. 3) Yes: the player is using what counts as an artificial aid to improve his performance. On top of that, there is clearly a risk of chalk remaining on the ball and getting into players' eyes. So as soon as you see him using the chalk, inform him that it is not allowed, and request that any ballboy equipped with the chalk dispenses with it immediately. Thanks to Salah Salah.

Pep Guardiola will have at least £150m to spend on players when he replaces Manuel Pellegrini as the Manchester City manager in the summer. The Spaniard’s salary will also rise to €20m (£15.2m) after it was confirmed he will move to the Etihad following the expiry of his contract with Bayern Munich. City’s standing as the richest club in the world along with next season’s record Premier League broadcast deal of £5.14bn means Guardiola will be given the backing to enter the market as he wishes in the close season. The club’s finances will be further swelled by the new overseas broadcast deal, expected to be a minimum of €3bn. He is a close friend of City’s director of football, Txiki Begiristain, and is expected to consult him regarding transfers before taking over on 1 July. Guardiola earns €17m at Bayern Munich but this is to increase by €3m in recognition of his standing as one of the world’s most sought after managers. City believed they were close to landing the 45-year-old in 2012 before he decided to take a sabbatical and this strengthened Guardiola’s bargaining position with regard to the three-year contract he signed. City are confident that now Pellegrini’s departure in the summer is official it will galvanise the squad into playing for the popular manager rather than making him a lame duck. Pellegrini has been aware of City’s preference for Guardiola since he replaced Roberto Mancini in June 2013 and would have been less accepting of the club’s move if it had been any other manager. Pellegrini was informed of the decision last week by Khaldoon al Mubarak, the City chairman, and it is understood the relationship between the two men remains amicable. The club have no problem with Pellegrini now talking with prospective clubs about where he may manage next. The view is that Chelsea could be interested and given the 62-year-old won the Premier League in his first season with City and wants to remain in English football Stamford Bridge would be of interest. Guardiola was confirmed as Pellegrini’s successor on Monday when the usually introverted Chilean decided to offer the news in an unsolicited soundbite at the close of his press conference before Tuesday’s visit to Sunderland. It suggested he may have driven the decision to make Guardiola’s appointment official. Pellegrini said: “Before I finish, I want to tell you I have talked with the club and I will finish my contract on the original date. I signed for one year more [to July 2017], but with the clause that the club or me can choose not to use that stuff now, so I finish here on the original date, 30 June, so there is not the speculation. “The club are not doing anything behind me, I knew this one month ago, but I don’t think it’s good to have rumour or speculation about these things, so I prefer to finish today, which I why I have told the players and I have told the press. I also spoke to the club two weeks ago and said that I would do it.” The club then released a statement. “Manchester City can confirm that in recent weeks it has commenced and finalised contractual negotiations with Pep Guardiola to become head coach for the 2016-17 season onwards. The contract is for three years. These negotiations were a re-commencement of discussions that were curtailed in 2012. “Out of respect for Manuel Pellegrini and the players, the club wishes to make its decision public to remove the unnecessary burden of speculation. Manuel, who is fully supportive of the decision to make this communication, is entirely focused on achieving his targets for the season ahead and retains the respect and commitment of all involved with the leadership of the club.” Mark Hughes, the Stoke City manager who has also been in charge at City, warned Guardiola the Premier League may be different to La Liga and the Bundesliga. “I don’t think the news itself is a surprise, maybe the timing of the announcement. It is very interesting,” he said. “The Premier League is unlike any other league in world football. He has been very successful, of course, but he will still need a bit of adaptation.” City believe they beat United and Chelsea to Guardiola’s signature, with sources at the club claiming “overtures” were made to the Spaniard. This, though, was denied at United and it is understood that as recently as December, the executive at Old Trafford viewed Guardiola’s favoured destination to be City.

USA took a step toward shaking off the ghosts of 2015 with an aggressive effort in rainy Carson, California, on Sunday to equalize twice and eventually edge out Iceland, 3-2. It was the late heroics from defender Steve Birnbaum in his second USA appearance that kept a sloppy defensive team performance from overshadowing a strong attacking effort. He nabbed the equalizing assist and game-winning goal, both on set pieces. In the 90th minute, Birnbaum rose to connect with a Michael Bradley set piece, to head past goalkeeper Ögmundur Kristinsson. Centre-back Michael Oroczo pulled the US level for a second time in the 59th minute, finishing a header from Birnbaum off a Bradley corner. Iceland were missing key personnel in attack, but still made the US pay dearly for defensive mistakes. Debutant Aron Sigurðarson scored Iceland’s second goal from a long-range, curling strike in the 66th minute after the American defense was caught off-guard. USA coach Jürgen Klinsmann yet again experimented with a new defensive four, which had a rocky start, leading to an early Iceland goal in front of a sparse crowd at the StubHub Center. A weak clearance in the 12th minute landed at the feet of Kristinn Steindórsson, whose deflected shot left goalkeeper Luis Robles with no chance to save. Orozco was a late addition to the US training camp, with Klinsmann calling him in Friday after the squad had been training together for two and a half weeks. As shaky as the USA defense looked when tested, the attack was strong, holding possession and out-shooting Iceland 16 to six. Jozy Altidore pulled USA level for the first time in the 20th minute after a nice sequence that started with Jermaine Jones in the Americans’ own half. Jones passed upfield to Gyasi Zardes, whose first time ball to Bradley was slipped into Altidore for a chip finish. “It’s the first game of the year – we’re trying to get our legs under us still,” Altidore said. “We’re working really hard in training and it’s nice to play against a real opponent and gets a few minutes.” “We have to get fitter, but that’s normal this time of the year,” he added. “We just need to be a little bit sharper. Sometimes that final pass wasn’t there, that first touch wasn’t there, but it will come in due time.” Though Sunday’s affair was only a friendly, Klinsmann will be keen to put a rough 2015 behind him. The US crashed out of the Concacaf Gold Cup for their worst finish since 2000 and then lost a playoff against Mexico for a berth in next year’s Confederations Cup. The under-23 squad failed to guarantee a spot in this summer’s Olympics after losing to Honduras in the semi-final of the Concacaf qualifying tournament, a competition Klinsmann named as a top priority for last year. Klinsmann took a different tact with his January camp leading up to Sunday’s match by calling in a mix of senior team and under-23 players that will face Colombia in a last-chance play-off for berth into the Rio Olympics. The senior squad, meanwhile, has 2018 World Cup qualifying and Copa America on the calendar later this year. Iceland represented a strong first opponent of 2016 for the US, having recently qualified for Euro 2016, the smallest country ever to qualify for the tournament. But key absences in Sunday’s starting line-up included strikers Gylfi Sigurðsson, Alfreð Finnbogason and Kolbeinn Sigþórsson. Sunday was the first meeting between Iceland and the US since 1994, having previously gone 2-2-2 in six matches. Klinsmann’s line-up showed an eye to the future as he handed out first caps while continuing to start a mix of veteran players like 34-year-old Jermaine Jones. Both Ethan Finlay and Kellyn Acosta earned their first caps for the senior team and Lee Nguyen earned his first start after seven previous caps. Cameroonian-American Tony Tchani and German-American Jerome Kiesewetter both made their US senior debuts as a second-half substitutes. The US will return to the StubHub Center for another friendly on Friday against Canada. Qualifying for the 2018 World Cup resumes in March against Guatemala.

1) Cupcake no more Time was the January team camps were something of a curio in American soccer – their strategic significance stranded somewhere between the years when the USA squad was a glorified club team, and the present era of tensions between MLS and Jürgen Klinsmann. The three week camps, and the friendlies that punctuate them, come during the MLS off-season and in the midst of crowded European schedules, so it’s understandable that when you look at the players with one or two international caps to their name, they tend to be MLS journeymen who’ve passed through these January camps, always more likely to feature on the “possible” rather than “probable” list for future rosters. No wonder, perhaps, that these camps once earned the disparaging nickname Camp Cupcake – with their air of “prizes for participation”. Yet the wave of US internationals who returned to MLS during the last World Cup year has changed the balance and stakes of these camps, and with it the sense of expectation and possibility that comes from them. The majority of the senior core of the team now plays in MLS. Also, the likes of Geoff Cameron, Graham Zusi and Matt Besler and latterly, Gyassi Zardes, have all made breakthroughs at the January camps, and with World Cup qualifying having started, a vital Olympic playoff coming up, as well as the Centenary Copa America this summer, this particular edition of the January camps has had a very particular charge to it. Add in the underwhelming 2015 performances by the US and Klinsmann, and there’s been a definite imperative for this camp and the performances that come out of it to look more defined than the long noodling experiment of the post-World Cup 2014 period. A patchy 3-2 home win over Iceland is hardly a definitive turning of the page, but it’s a start. And while there was the usual January shake up of personnel, surely – surely – even Klinsmann must be moving beyond experimentation for experimentation’s sake. All of the players at this camp should be considered a realistic part of the picture for the 2018 World Cup. That said… 2) Nobody quite seized their chance It took until the second half against Iceland for any debutants to make an impression – and when they did it was an Iceland player. Aron Sigurdarson was a lively presence and deserved his goal in the 48th minute, when he took advantage of a horrible lack of concentration from US players as they were caught ball-watching on a quickly taken Iceland free-kick. Before that, various fringe US players had had largely anonymous days, with one or two moments they’ll want to forget. The promising Dallas player Kellyn Acosta may have been deployed out of position as a full-back, but should still have done better with his own bout of ball-watching on the lead-up to Iceland’s opener in the 13th minute, and Ethan Finlay looked serviceable rather than inspiring. Lee Nguyen did nothing particularly bad, without suggesting he’s a long-term threat to Clint Dempsey. In the second-half though, there were some intriguing cameos. Steven Birnbaum ended up scoring the winner with a well placed header, as well as an assist to help level the scores in the 59th minute. He had his share of blame for some lax defending from the US in the second-half, but his prowess on set pieces at the other end might have done enough to get him more minutes this Friday against Canada. Most impressive though was the urgency and movement that arrived with the introduction of Jerome Kiesewetter and Jordan Morris for the last 15 minutes of the game. Morris is no secret, and the newly minted Seattle player provided his familiar burst of intelligent movement in the final third – helping pin Iceland back just as they were beginning to cause the US problems. And Kiesewetter’s speed and touch down the right suggested a fearless young player determined to seize his chance. He and Morris are said to enjoy playing together and it showed in their brief time on the field. And with nobody else truly making a compelling case, if Kiesewetter plays this Friday he has the chance to become the breakthrough player from the camp. 3) The biggest center-back intrigue happened off the field This weekend saw two significant center-back signings for Klinsmann’s 2018 planning. Matt Miazga only got his chance in the New York Red Bulls team last year when an opening day injury to Ronald Zubar gifted him a run in the team. But by the end of 2015 he’d transitioned rapidly through the US national team youth ranks to full international status, and by the last weekend of January 2016 he had signed for Chelsea – and absented himself from the national team camp to do so. And at the same time as Miazga was continuing his rapid ascent, John Brooks was signing a new contract with Hertha Berlin. Brooks is a young player who Klinsmann has given plenty of time to come good in the national side – to a degree that critics might call over-indulgence – and consolidating his toehold in German domestic soccer should keep him in his national team coach’s favor. In the absence of that pair, Michael Orozco and Matt Besler started against Iceland. Besler has been here before – becoming an unlikely starter at the World Cup alongside the talented but erratic Omar Gonzalez. Gonzalez himself was last seen being unveiled as Darth Vader by Pachuca, after finding himself on the outs at LA Galaxy during this off-season. Whether he has the tenacity to win back the golden boy position currently occupied by Miazga is just one of the center-back questions to ponder. On the field itself, Besler and Orozco didn’t do a lot to suggest they were going to make speculation about absent colleagues an irrelevance, despite Orozco getting a goal. Both were given the full 90 minutes to impress, and both failed, in a shaky US defensive performance. Klinsmann may be closer to his World Cup pairing at the back, but they weren’t playing against Iceland. 4) The midfield pivot is still an issue It might seem churlish to complain about the midfield pivot in the 4-2-3-1 when said pivot has done what it was intended to do, and facilitated a man of the match performance from Michael Bradley. So to accentuate the positive first – Bradley had another very good game against European opposition – helping his side to a third successive win over such opposition for the first time in 25 years. Bradley got into dangerous positions to act as playmaker, as well as providing his usual degree of danger from dead balls. Making him tick is always the USA’s best hope of a result against quality opposition, and with Jermaine Jones performing the defensive duties, Bradley was able to play without the burden of responsibility that sometimes sees him spread too thin on the field. But Jones will not be the starter in that position at the next World Cup, and nor will Kyle Beckerman, who performed a similar limited role at the last World Cup. It’s arguably better to see Jones as a placeholder than it is seeing him be shoehorned into a center-back role, as Klinsmann has previously tried to do. And there’s also a case to be made that after the let downs of last year, Klinsmann needed his most solid midfield platform in place to make sure of any kind of performance against Iceland, particularly with other new moving parts in place in front of them. But there was something symbolic about watching Perry Kitchen agitating in vain on the sideline to try and make his substitute’s appearance before the final whistle. In fairness Klinsmann had already given Tony Tchani a shot in lieu of Jones for the last 20 minutes, but there’s a real feel of a developmental bottleneck at that position that needs to be resolved sooner rather than later. Klinsmann needs to commit to a long term replacement for Jones, or at least become more serious about who the contenders are. If he was watching at home you could have forgiven Dax McCarty, to name but one, for shaking his head in frustration. He, Tchani or Kitchen might not be the answer, but seeing Jones in this context told us nothing new. 5) We missed a chance to see Darlington Nagbe shine Darlington Nagbe played for 29 minutes against Iceland, coming on as sub to play out wide. It was a fairly standard cameo appearance under Klinsmann – long enough to potentially do something, anything, but not quite playing the player where he can do what he does best. Nagbe’s not alone in being set a challenge like that by his international coach, but he’s also one of the few players in the emerging generation of US players who has the potential to be a potent weapon if deployed correctly (ask Caleb Porter what switching Darlington Nagbe to the middle does for your team…). Of course, the same claim might be made about Nguyen, who played 90 minutes against Iceland as the notional creator in the center, but Nguyen has not reached the heights of his 2014 season with New England of late, and did nothing to suggest he should either replace the aging Dempsey long-term, or remain ahead of Nagbe in the immediate future. It was clear against Iceland that Nagbe wanted to come inside at every opportunity, and clear that not giving him the freedom to do so meant he never touched his potential. He was muted. His long wait for citizenship roughly coincided with his club coach finally trusting him to play in the center of the field – a move that ended up being rewarded with Portland Timbers lifting MLS Cup, after a winning run inspired by a liberated Nagbe. Klinsmann’s yet to make a similar leap of faith. Nagbe’s in the national team picture, but for now, still too close to the edge of it.

Many will just shrug and mutter good riddance. They will point to the controversies which cost John Terry his captaincy of England, twice, and to that depressing day in October 2011 when rival centre-halves tangled at Loftus Road, arguing and eyeballing each other, and what might have been a playground squabble amid the frenzy of a derby erupted into something far more sinister. Life has rarely been simple where Terry is concerned, his rough edges far from smoothed even after 18 years in the professional game. But those who cram into the stands at Chelsea, whether old school or new breed, recognise his qualities more readily. An icon, the likes of whom they may never see again, is bidding farewell. This parting will be painful. Like him or loathe him, Terry, more than any of that celebrated spine which so flourished under José Mourinho and, invariably, his successors, personifies the modern-day Chelsea. The locals latched on to him as one of their own. Generations of youth-team players have graduated through the academy hoping but failing to follow in the footsteps of a player who first arrived at Harlington as a 14-year-old and, at 17, was replacing Dan Petrescu four minutes from time in a League Cup win against Aston Villa. Sunday’s thrashing of MK Dons, a club still five years from existence when Terry made that senior debut, was his 696th appearance. Only Ron Harris and Peter Bonetti boast more. Yet the man for whom that banner still proudly screams “Captain, Leader, Legend” up in the Matthew Harding stand represented the heartbeat of a club suddenly money-flushed and morphing around him. When Roman Abramovich’s takeover lured internationals from all over the globe to Stamford Bridge, Terry was the rock upon which the team was built. He was ferocious in his tackling, meticulous in his organisation of a defence, an uncompromising figure unperturbed whether barking instructions at World Cup or Champions League winners who had been plucked from France, Italy, Portugal or Germany to play in his team. Reputations meant nothing because, in-house at least, only his really counted. No defender boasts more than his 40 goals in the Premier League. His forceful personality could dominate the dressing room, and the power-base he enjoyed within that cabal of senior players was not always healthy, but those within the set-up accepted the standing he held within the club. Mourinho recognised his significance early, seizing upon a player who could hoist a team’s performance out on the pitch by his mere, imposing presence. Fabio Capello was so smitten he twice appointed him as his national captain, and stood by his man even when the player’s misdemeanours effectively cost the Italian his job. He was the manager’s eyes and ears out on the pitch, a player in whom they placed their trust. Those head coaches who doubted him tended to regret it in the end, either because they fell victim to the politics surrounding his status, or because their lineups simply lacked the authority he could bring. He has never been quick, as he admitted himself recently, but he read the game well and, from that berth on the left of the two centre-halves, forged partnerships which claimed Chelsea trophies: he excelled alongside Ricardo Carvalho and William Gallas in 2005 and 2006; then Alex, even the erratic David Luiz and, of late, Gary Cahill. At international level he chalked up 78 caps and appearances at four major tournaments. With his club his presence was simply taken for granted. He missed only one league game when Carlo Ancelotti’s side claimed the title in 2010 and, when injuries were supposed to have blunted his edge, played every minute of last season’s success. Some of his displays leading up to that triumph last May rivalled the best of his club career. And yet he never quite separated the pristine from the pantomime. There was that slip in the penalty shootout amid the deluge in Moscow in 2008, his effort skewing wide to pass up the chance to claim his club’s first European Cup and leaving him in tears. When Chelsea did achieve that in Munich four years later, Terry was watching on from the sidelines, suspended for a petulant kick out at Barcelona’s Alexis Sánchez in the semi-final at Camp Nou. He sat next to Frank Lampard on the return flight from Catalonia, a subdued figure with gleeful bedlam all around, still unable really to explain what had come over him to induce such indiscipline. His career is punctured with similar sources of regret – many found their way on to the pages, front and back, of national newspapers – and there was that far from subtle courting of Manchester City in the summer of 2009 which, ultimately, earned him a contract the likes of which Chelsea had never previously offered. Yet, for all those occasions when he veered into controversy, Terry can end his career at this club merely pointing to the silverware as evidence of his impact: there were four Premier League titles; three League Cups; five FA Cups, with the possibility of a sixth if the team maintain their recent upturn in form; a Europa League, and a European Cup collected in full kit, as per Uefa regulations, at the Allianz Arena four years ago. Of that squad, only Branislav Ivanovic, John Mikel Obi and Cahill will remain come the summer. Ramires departed for China last week, and Terry may now follow him east. A traumatic domestic season has ended up as a cleansing operation, an opportunity to start again, with Chelsea seeking new management and fresh perspective in the summer. Unearthing the next generation of leaders, players who can inspire a team relentlessly to success, is an onerous task. Frank Lampard was cherished, Didier Drogba idolised, Ashley Cole quietly admired and Petr Cech worshipped for years and will continue to be despite three of that quartet having returned at some stage to Stamford Bridge in rivals’ ranks. It feels inconceivable that Terry would one day be the enemy. He was last off the turf, as usual, at Stadium MK with that chest thumping salute before making public the divorce. Chelsea’s support will miss him most of all because he was one of their own.

Fulham have angrily called off Moussa Dembélé’s proposed £6m move to Tottenham Hotspur after a row over the centre-forward’s loan-back arrangement. The west London club have insisted all along that Dembélé cannot and will not be allowed to play elsewhere for the remainder of the season given their precarious position just above the Championship relegation places and the imperative to keep hold of one of their few goal threats. Their position has been thrown into sharper focus by the club being under a Football League transfer embargo. Fulham negotiated a deal with Tottenham that would allow the 19-year-old to sign off on the deal now but return to Craven Cottage until the end of May. Dembélé’s Fulham contract expires at the end of the season and even though he would then be permitted to move as a free agent, they would still receive a fee for him at tribunal if he were to join an English club. Dembélé underwent a medical at Tottenham on Saturday and the transaction looked set to be confirmed. But Tottenham have continued to push for the player to be allowed to join them straight away to the point where it became a deal-breaker. There is understood to be precious little chance of the deal being revived before the window shuts on Monday night. Amid acrimony and accusations of agreements being reneged upon, Dembélé has been left disappointed and Tottenham will have to look elsewhere for the cover up front for Harry Kane that they need immediately. They could make a move for West Bromwich Albion’s Saido Berahino, the striker that they unsuccessfully tried to sign last summer. Fulham are also set to tie their other main forward, Ross McCormack, to a lucrative, new long-term contract. The club rejected a £9m offer for McCormack from Middlesbrough and then turned down a transfer request he submitted. But he has been appeased by their offer of increased terms and he is expected to sign on Monday. Another transfer which has seemingly fallen through is Jordan Rhodes’s move from Blackburn Rovers to Middlesbrough. Rhodes was quoted as being “baffled and disappointed” by Middlesbrough’s decision to withdraw from the deal. The forward said he passed a medical and agreed personal terms on a switch to the Riverside Stadium on Saturday, but was informed on Sunday morning that Middlesbrough had cancelled the move. However, Middlesbrough have claimed the deal broke down because they were unable to agree terms with Rhodes. “The club can confirm that we have held talks with Blackburn Rovers striker Jordan Rhodes over the weekend but have failed to agree terms,” a statement from the club’s official website read. On Friday Middlesbrough released a statement confirming they had agreed a fee with Blackburn for Rhodes, who is contracted at Ewood Park until July 2019. The transfer fee was reportedly worth £11m – £9m up front and £2m in add-ons. But Rhodes now looks set to see out the 2015-16 campaign with Blackburn. Rhodes has scored 85 goals in 169 matches for Blackburn since leaving Huddersfield, where he netted 87 times in 148 games, in a deal worth up to £8m in August 2012.

Manchester City have rarely been accused of economy since the Abu Dhabi millions began to roll in so when Manuel Pellegrini was asked if the club had saved money by employing Kelechi Iheanacho he was momentarily nonplussed. City did have to beat off other leading clubs around Europe to sign the Nigerian for their academy, though the manager had just made the point that because he was ready for the first team there had been no need to replace Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic. “We are not thinking about saving money,” Pellegrini said. “Kelechi deserves his place in the squad and as you have just seen he is ready to play.” So impressive was Iheanacho’s hat-trick against a limp Aston Villa the striker is likely to be promoted to the Champions League squad in the next few days, because he is fit and ready to play and Wilfried Bony is still struggling with injury. But the FA Cup hero will have to take a back seat for the league game at Sunderland on Tuesday when Sergio Agüero and David Silva are likely to return. “They are both fit and rested, so we will probably be naming our strongest team for the next match.” Pellegrini said. “Kelechi is making good progress, he is improving in every game. He is a good professional and he has an excess of confidence.” Aston Villa could do with some of that. From the moment Iheanacho pounced on a loose ball after a Fernando header to open the scoring, the home side never looked capable of rescuing the situation. Iheanacho’s penalty midway through the first half after Raheem Sterling had been fouled confirmed the worst fears of the threadbare home crowd, and when Idrissa Gueye presented the 19-year-old with a third goal with a woefully underhit back pass it seemed to sum up Villa’s tepid and timid approach. Iheanacho might even have had a fourth shortly afterwards but his attempted overhead shot turned instead into an assist for Sterling and leave last season’s beaten finalists to concentrate on their parlous league position. “We started very poorly and it didn’t get any better,” Rémi Garde said, in an accurate summary of a disappointingly one-sided game. “Considering the quality of the players they left on the bench one could only be impressed by how competitive a side City were able to put out.” Villa too had made several changes, but were nowhere near a match in terms of competitiveness. “I made changes because I had to,” Garde said. “We have three games in seven days and I have some players who cannot cope physically with that sort of schedule.” He looks weary but is not yet ready to throw in the towel. “We fight on,” he said. “It is not easy but I am here to do my best for the team, not save my own skin.” Man of the match Kelechi Iheanacho (Manchester City)

Click to enlarge, and debate the strip below the line. Keith Hackett's verdict 1) You have to intervene here, you can't allow this to happen. The guidance is clear on this: equipment of this type – cameras, TV monitors etc – cannot be used in the technical area. Authorities can now impose retrospective punishments based on video evidence, as happened to Diego Costa recently, but that does not mean teams can start filming each other from the dugout just in case. After the match, report what happened to the FA. Thanks to Christian Jackson. 2) In my long career I was hit by the ball only once. Sadly, in my case, the ball deflected off me into the path of the No9, who blasted it into the net – and I had to award the goal. In this scenario, too, the goal stands. Thank your assistant for taking responsibility and not immediately stopping the game, and confirm with him that the goal was valid. After that, though, you really need to relinquish your duties – it's not safe to continue after being knocked out. Arrange for a colleague to step in. Professor Robert W. Zoellner wins the shirt. 3) You have no idea what the substance is, and you have no way of finding out. This player may be diabetic, so the injection may be perfectly legitimate. All you can do is have a word, make sure the syringe is safely disposed of, then allow him to enter the game as normal. Mention it in your post-match report. Thanks to Sheikh Sal.

Click to enlarge, and debate the strip below the line. Keith Hackett's verdict 1) Stop play immediately and send off both defenders for violent conduct. The striker has been badly let down by his colleagues here – their idiocy has denied him the chance to score. And not only that, they have also handed the opposition a great chance, as you have to restart play with an indirect free-kick from where the defenders were fighting, inside their own penalty area. Thanks to Mike Herbert. 2) Stop play and show the defender a yellow card. It's not a red card for denying an obvious goalscoring opportunity because defenders are allowed to make clean tackles – his only offence here is coming on to the field without permission. Restart with an indirect free-kick to the attacking team from where he entered play. Thanks to David Millward. 3) Without hesitation, show the defender a red card for his disgusting behaviour, and point to the penalty spot. This is just like a sliding challenge which begins outside the penalty area but makes contact with an opponent inside the area – the offence take place at the point of contact.

Click to enlarge, and debate the strip below the line. Keith Hackett's answers 1) You have to be aware of gamesmanship on both sides. Having rightly cautioned the striker for showing the imaginary card you should then make sure you give him the appropriate protection, to avoid this sort of escalation. Tell him that you're aware the opposition players are targeting him to try and force a second yellow, and at the next opportunity take the opposition captain to one side to issue his team with a public warning that their tactic must stop. With that warning in place, you should then caution the next player who fouls this individual. Thanks to David Millward. 2) Another great question to start the season. "Intent" is no longer in the laws; in this case the defender has simply committed a foul as a result of carelessness – however unintentional it was. So restart with a direct free kick, and dismiss the defender for the denial of an obvious goal scoring opportunity. Kyla Watkins, aged 10¾, wins the shirt. 3) Under no circumstances accept the shirt on the pitch – whether it's a genuine gesture or not. Thank the captain for his wonderful gesture and suggest that, because you want to photograph the moment, he should keep his shirt on until you can do a formal presentation in your dressing room.

Click to enlarge, and debate the strip below the line. Keith Hackett's answers 1) You can only take action on what you see. To punish a handball offence you have to be sure it was deliberate, and you have to be able to identify the offender. Given that you were partly unsighted here, you can't make a sound judgment on either point. So, award the goal. Never guess. Thanks to Alex Von Fintel. 2) Goal. The Law says: "It is not an offence in itself for a player who is in an offside position to step off the field of play to show the referee that he/she is not involved in active play." So it is fine for her to step off the field without the referee's permission. A clever tactic. Alan Bullock wins the shirt. 3) It's a clear case of DOGSO – the denial of an obvious goalscoring opportunity. But who to punish is less clear. Whenever offences are simultaneous, the advice to referees is to choose one of the offenders and show that individual a red card. So make your choice – ideally based on the severity of the challenges rather than who you like least – then award a penalty.

Click to enlarge, and debate the strip below the line. Keith Hackett's verdict 1) The manager is wrong. The technical area isn't his own personal empire – it's simply a designated zone from where he can convey tactical instructions while, say the laws, "behaving in a responsible manner". Ask him to stand aside to allow the player space to take the kick – and if he fails to respond in a positive manner, send him to the stands for delaying the restart. Brian Fitch wins the shirt. 2) The simplest way to approach this is to say that one of these two throws was clearly taken from the wrong position. Stop play and restart with a retaken throw from the correct spot, and, if necessary, have a quiet word with the over-eager ballboys. Thanks to Walker Boyd. 3) Caution the team-mate for dissent and award an indirect free-kick to the defending side. This strip has been making the point for over 50 years – you are the ref, and it's your decision: players do not run the game. This player has turned an attacking position into a defending position, and earned himself a yellow card. Hopefully he will learn the lesson. Thanks to Tom Easby.

Click to enlarge, and debate the strip below the line. Keith Hackett's verdict 1) The key with any handball decision is whether or not the action was deliberate. His arm clearly was not in a natural position, but the fact that his eyes were closed suggests it can't have been a deliberate offence. You cannot award a penalty here – play on. Thanks to Steve Longworth. 2) Wow. That's an instinct that needs to be kept under control. Quickly get a grip: blow your whistle, signal clearly that it's not a goal and apologise to both captains. You are considered part of the field of play – similar to a goalpost or flagpost – so had the ball hit you accidentally and deflected into the net it would have been a valid goal. But because you deliberately played the ball, the game has to be stopped. Restart with a dropped ball, then report yourself to the authorities after the match. You can expect an extended break. Ian Mathieson wins the shirt. 3) There's no offence here – play on. The defender entered the area after the kick was taken, so if he can outpace the ball and reach it before it crosses the line, he's done nothing wrong. Equally, had a striker entered the area after the kick was taken and reached the ball first, he would have been entitled to toe-poke it into the net for a valid goal. Thanks to Ryszard Kaleta.

PEP TALK The Fiver’s going to come clean. There we were sweating profusely as we tried to come up with Plain Old John Terry gags that were either not funny but legally OK, or, erm, not funny and still not legally OK (oh yes, it was really going to be a classic Fiver) when we saw Really Big Yellow Ticker of Doom pop up on our screen. Ah, maybe Daniel Trickett-Smith has finally joined Huddersfield on loan we thought. But no, in news that was even bigger than that, Pep Guardiola has been confirmed as Manchester City manager for next season. Poor old POJT, having his Fiver party crashed by a man who wasn’t even wearing a full kit and shin pads. “Manchester City can confirm that in recent weeks it has commenced and finalised contractual negotiations with Pep Guardiola to become MCFC Head Coach for the 2016-17 EPL season onwards,” cheered a City suit, in news that was only marginally more surprising than Weird Uncle Fiver’s latest restraining order. And then in a highly uncalled for public kick in the stones for Manuel Pellegrini, the cold-hearted suit made it clear that the wise and lovely old owl currently perched in the City manager’s job was always second choice, nothing more than a football management equivalent of a cruise-control button. “The contract is for three years. These negotiations were a re-commencement of discussions that were curtailed in 2012. Out of respect for Manuel Pellegrini and the players, the club wishes to make its decision public to remove the unnecessary burden of speculation.” Yes, respect. Because being viewed as a corpse stalking the streets in a polyester Manchester City coat for the next five months is going to help Pellegrini do his job so much better now isn’t it? At least Pep might be easier for The Fiver to relate to, what with his super smart appearance, fastidious attention to detail, huge ambition and searing success. Ah. So what can English football expect from a man so driven by detail that Manchester City employed Txiki Begiristain three years ago just to ensure the Etihad cushions were correctly plumped in time for his arrival? Well, he’ll probably be short on laughs (cough) and he’ll create formations that nobody understands, not even floating football brain in a jar, Jonathan Wilson, and certainly not the players. “Guardiola thinks about football and understands the machinations of the game at a level so deep that no one can follow,” revealed a Bayern Munich suit in a Big Paper interview a few months ago that got football hipsters twiddling their Brian Kilcline-styled facial hair with glee. It’s an approach that will surely go down well in the Premier League, where managers’ tactical plans go out of the window at the first sign of a gust of wind. But one thing we can be sure of this afternoon is that no amount of cake will sweeten Yaya Touré’s mood, what with him having been escorted towards the Nou Camp’s door marked Do One by Pep in 2010. Here’s what Touré’s Mr 15%, Dimitri Seluk, had to say about Guardiola a couple of weeks ago: “The truth is that my grandfather would win the title with Barcelona and Bayern Munich because they are big clubs with great players. I’d like to see Pep take a club that is eighth or ninth and make them champions.” The Fiver’s going to take a wild guess and predict that Yaya will be a no-no when Pep steps in.

Stoke City are set to break their transfer record by signing the French-Belgian midfielder Giannelli Imbula from Porto for £18m (€24m). The 23-year-old was still in Portugal on Monday morning but talks advanced quickly with Stoke agreeing to Porto having a 15% sell-on clause included in the deal, according to maisfutebol. Imbula, who joined Porto from Marseille in 2015, has been capped seven times by France at Under-21 level but has yet to play for the senior team and recently suggested he would be keen to represent Belgium. Stoke’s previous record fee was the £12m paid to Internazionale for Xherdan Shaqiri in August of last year. Imbula was the most expensive signing in the history of Portuguese football when he joined Porto in a €20m deal.

Click to enlarge, and debate the strip below the line. Keith Hackett's verdict 1) The keeper may well have tried to deny an obvious scoring opportunity, but he clearly failed – the ball ended up in his net. So, instead of the red card you were preparing to show him, penalise him with a yellow for deliberately handling the ball outside his area and award the goal. Andrew Lindsay wins the shirt. 2) Send him off – it's a second yellow. The game may be over but offences that take place after the final whistle are still offences and they have to be dealt with. The striker has made a stupid mistake – he must know the law about removing shirts during goal celebrations and flouting it means he could now end up being suspended for the biggest game of his life. It's a crazy way to end up banned – but you have to apply the laws fairly and consistently. Thanks to Peter Jordan. 3) In normal circumstances a keeper who takes longer than six seconds to release the ball is not booked – you would simply award an indirect free-kick to the attacking team from the edge of the penalty area. But in these circumstances, he is clearly guilty of unsporting behaviour, having had multiple previous warnings for the same offence – so show him a second yellow. Play resumes with an indirect free-kick, once a replacement goalkeeper is in position. Thanks to Sam Bolton.

Click to enlarge, and debate the strip below the line. Keith Hackett's verdict 1) Devious, but it's not a goal. The keeper's fall was a direct result of the actions of the striker, who is clearly guilty of some pretty underhand unsporting behaviour. Disallow the goal, call the striker back and show him a yellow card, and restart with a free-kick to the defending team which can be taken from anywhere inside the six-yard box. Thanks to Dave Lomax. 2) An interesting problem, and another which shows you need to be ready to think on your feet and apply the laws as fairly as you can. The substitution, technically, has been completed – but a member of your team has made a genuine error, so I would show some common sense by allowing the substitution to be redone. You need to report the error to the authorities, post-match, though. Thanks to Phillip Mercer. 3) No, you can spare the player's blushes. The law on advantage is clear: you have to penalise the original offence if the anticipated advantage does not transpire in that immediate passage of play. So take play back to the original incident and award a free-kick at the position where the player was fouled. Stephen Boustred wins the shirt.

In the end even Chelsea’s most scintillating display of a baffling campaign was overshadowed by their captain’s post-match desire to get something off his chest. John Terry’s contribution had gone almost unnoticed here, a first-half booking and some typically robust defending aside, while others dazzled further up the field. He would have his moment afterwards with confirmation he is to leave Chelsea in the summer. Up to then it had been the creative talents who had dazzled. This was a brutal reminder of the gulf between the top two divisions, even if Chelsea still loiter in 13th in the top flight, with MK Dons swatted aside with ease and Guus Hiddink’s team revelling in the space afforded them by cowed opponents. A proper test awaits in the last 16 when Manchester City visit Stamford Bridge. “That is already a final,” offered the interim manager on the challenge to come. What is encouraging, at least, is that his team have finally come into some form. Nine games unbeaten, they can afford to look to the immediate future with some optimism. This was an occasion for their forwards, granted space and time to revel, to showcase their talents. Oscar found the level to his liking, the Brazil international running riot to register his first hat-trick for the league champions before the break. There was even reward for Eden Hazard, from the penalty spot, to end a personal goal drought which had extended over 2,358 minutes and 30 matches since the header nodded beyond Julián Speroni to claim the Premier League title in May: a winner from another era. Chelsea are starting to recall what it is like to be that dominant again. It was their movement which bamboozled their opponents. A defence which has proved porous in the Championship simply could not cope as Chelsea poured through them at will. The brief period when MK Dons enjoyed parity was deceptive, given the sheer number of opportunities they were shipping even then. David Martin performed heroically for a while but it was unfair to expect that excellence to be maintained. Eventually Chelsea would find their range and, as it was, Oscar still departed at the break having claimed the match ball with all prospect of a shock having long since dissipated. The rat-a-tat of chances had the home centre-halves wheezing. Martin saved wonderfully well from Diego Costa inside the opening four minutes, pushing away the striker’s close-range shot after Hazard and Oscar had combined to liberate the striker just outside the six-yard box. That combination play became a recurring theme, busy players galloping into space with the home ranks outnumbered, outpaced and simply dizzied by it all. “We could have been 4-0 down after five minutes,” said the Dons’ manager, Karl Robinson. “The only lesson I’ll learn from this is don’t win in the third round. We were carved up far too easily. It was scary.” Oscar twice poked just wide when it seemed easier to score, on each occasion the Brazilian’s body shape a little awkward as he struck his attempt, though it mattered little while the opportunities kept coming. All three of his goals came gift-wrapped, the Dons’ indecision contributing to the third – the most eye-catching of his three – which was emphatically dispatched into the corner beyond a shell-shocked Martin with no hint of a defensive block after the Brazilian had skipped infield across the edge of the penalty box. Kyle McFadzean suffered at the first two concessions. The centre-half had collected a throw-in on 15 minutes and attempted a blind pass infield, only to dribble the ball straight to a rampaging Costa. The striker charged into the area and drew the goalkeeper before squaring for Oscar to score past Joe Walsh on the line. Ruben Loftus-Cheek provided the visitors’ second, sliding a pass through the centre for Oscar to collect before McFadzean was aware of his presence, the finish crisply clipped into the far corner from an unkind angle. Throw in a wonderful save from Martin to turn Hazard’s attempt on to the woodwork and Costa glancing Baba Rahman’s centre wide with Oscar perfectly positioned at his side to tap into an unguarded net and it was hard to fathom how, albeit only for a brief interlude, the Dons had once threatened a revival. Encouraged by Rob Hall’s early dash to the edge of the Chelsea penalty area they sensed some vulnerability in the Premier League side’s ranks which Darren Potter, courtesy of a deflection from Nemanja Matic’s block, had exploited to put the home side level. Yet that was their high point, a brief riposte amid incessant pressure. Hazard’s dart into the box induced a foul from Potter early in the second period, the Belgian picking himself up to score from the penalty spot. He was soon skipping unchecked to the byline once again and pulling the ball back for the substitute, Bertrand Traoré, to sidefoot in his first Chelsea goal. Costa, who had made way for the youngster, was busy signing autographs and taking selfies with the supporters behind the dugout by that stage. It was that kind of stroll. Man of the match Oscar (Chelsea).
